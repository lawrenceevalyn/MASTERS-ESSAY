Louise, accompanied by the little Lout son Le Blanc was the bearer of a message from the lady abbess of the neighbouring Carmelite convent to Мя dome Perdu, saying, she would be happy to be introduced to her, and begging, at the same time, that she would, when ever she pleased, attend their chapel She was an English lady, and among her community were ladies of the same nation as herself With delight, there foie, the lady Geraldine repaired to the sacred edifice , and great was her joy «hen, in the chief of the house, she recognised one of hei former school mates Their meeting was accompanied by tears, and from the abbess, Geral dine had the satisfaction of hearing of many of her English friends, but what was of the greatest importance, she learnt that one of the young ladies of the con vent was л chosen friend of Angelina, and that, as far as the rules of the house would permit, they corresponded regu«
3 larly As this nun had never seen Geraldine, and the lady abbess was careful to speak of Madame Perdu as an old friend, without disclosing her buth, no suspicion was excited in the bosom of Sister Frances, the nun ш questior, that Madame Perdu was the identical Geraldine of whom her friend made so much mention " If, said Angelina, in her last letter, " I could but find this Geraldine, and her hateful husband, my anxieties wouid be termi¬ nated , but at present, I have no happi¬ ness, even m the enjoyment of wealth, of rank, of beauty, and admiration While Richard Ravenspur lives at large, I do not consider myself safe My dear steter, how greatly I pity your present rigorou* privation from those scenes which youi person and rank would so well adorn The time may come that I shall return to Italy then, my friend, I wilt use my influence for your removal from the sok tary convent where you noi? are ste¬ li г

of her conventual duties were not at all in unison with the gaiety and ambition ofher natural disposition, and she ven tured to express as much to the lady Angelina, previous to her quitting Italy The latter, who was as warm in her attachment as violent m her hatied, promised to use her influence for the removal of her former friend, but her departure from her native coun¬ try, impeded the execution of her intentions Circumstances afterwards occurred, however, which accelerated the transportation of Sister Frances from the convent of Agen, and rendered htr totally subst ívient to the will of Ange lina, who was the chief instrument m her removal But to return to Raíenspur s family Geraldine seldom failed to visit the con vent daily, and her health, strength, and spirits, recovered their former elasticity So comfortable, indeed, were they in their present commodious dwelling, в 3
β that Ravenspur proposed fetching Ger¬ trude, as he had now wholly relin¬ quished the idea of journeying into Spain. Much of his time he spent witlf the fisherman of the hut; and often¬ times Geraldine, with her boy, would accompany them on their fishing excur- «¡on. They were always attended by Jaques, and either Robert or Thomas, upon tbese occasions. Sometimes they took provision for the day with them, and the elder fisherman would then amuse them, with pointing out the most remarkable features in the surrounding landscape, and describe the different spots which had been consecrated by the presence of Edward the Black Prince, whom he had often seen, and whom he enthusiastically admired: at others, he would talk of storms and tempests, and dangers he had undergone by land and sea, while his delighted auditors, in listening to the narrative ol' the animated old man, would repay him

by their smiles, for all the dangers and difficulties he had encountered One evening that they were reposing lux unantly under the shade of a grove of acacias, in a spot so retired that it seemed hundreds of miles distant from all the habitations of mankind, they heard the sound of voices m high dis pute The expressive countenance of Ravenspur betrayed alarm, and, looking earnestly at his lady, whose colour went and came so quickly that he dreaded the eftect such exceeding agitation would produce, he placed himself be¬ fore hei and his lovely boy, who, tired with play, had sunk upon the grass, and fallen into a sweet sleep Jaques and Robert, who were at a short distance, instantly approached, the fisherman observed them with surprise " I tell you," said one of the voices, " I will land, this lad says we are not tar from Agen , that is the direct road to the Pyrenees в 4

" Our lives are in danger' replied Raven«pur, " one of those men's voices is known to me " ' You are puisued by enemies then, resumed Marteau , " then trust to mt Do you, Jaques, take up that sleeping boy, and go to my hut Give my son a hint of what is going on here ' Give up my boy ' not for woilds began the lady, but ere she could

Ak, who ıs so happy, so happy as me, I 'm as blithe as a bird, I 'ra as brisk as a bee | I nee with the sun, and I lish all the day, And with joy I behold his last slanting ray. Fol then I return to my dear little cot, And bless my kind stars for so happy a lot My wife runs to meet me with smil"3 and a song, Declares, when 1 'm gone, that the day is so long, While the children, with shouts, proclaim my return, And heap up the fuel, and pile up fresh fern, To dry my wet clothes, and to dress the tine lish I have caught for our supper, and make a good dish By the time Marteau had proceeded thus far in his song, the boat drew close to the shore ; he rose, and calling out, exclaimed—" Holla ! mes amis—what · do you want any help V' —" Not from -you," replied one of the men ; " not from no such old singing fools "—" Yes, but we do though," interrupted his compa¬ nion ; " I dare say, iny good friend, you can assist us very much ; and I can tell you, old man, we' 11 make it wortli your while "
11
" Ah t" said Marteau, with a shrug, ' Je suis pauvre, bien pauvre " " Then you are the man we want, needy, I suppose, out of conceit of tbe world, and ill paid by it, eh, friend'" said thc fellow who addressed him " Justement,'' replied Marteau —" Well then, my fine fellow, listen to mc The old fisherman put himself in the attitude of a listener as the fellow pro¬ ceeded thus — " We are strangers in this part of the country, and in pursuit of an Eng¬ lish lord, who has disguised himself in a pilgrim's habit, and being well in¬ formed upon the subject, we understand that he and his family arc concealed somewhere near this spot, his brother— however, the government, I mean, is very anxious to secure his person— and------" " Hold your tongue, you fool," in¬ terrupted his companion, " why, what a pretty fellow you are to be intrusted b6
12
with a secret bay no inore, or by St Paul, I '11 send this trusty dagger through vour body , why, you are mad, have you lost your wits' Do you know thu grey headed old fool' whose grin is as expressive of villany as any grin I ever saw " Then he is the better for oui work, drily ieplied his companion " It is uo good deed that vie are employed upon—no honest man, and that s saying as much for you as for myself, would do our business Nay, goott Ugolino, put up youi dagger 1 care not for you noi vour dagger neither I say this fellow here (Marteau bowed to tath of them) is precisely the peison vve want, and III prove it Heai ye, old ^ity beard, is there not a convent of Carmelite nuns in this neighbouihood 9 " Oh qu'oui was the ıeply ' And the abbess lesiuucd the mteirogator, is old mothei Theiesd ' — ' Juste ment was agam the reply " And
13
pray, added he, " was there not a com pany of pilgrims which stopped at Agen sometime since ' Marttan nodded " And changed then minds—and----- " Messieurs, interrupted Marteau ' will you permit me to tell you «ill I know upon this subject, for I perteive very plainly, that the moment is arrived for enriching my poor family Please to take a seat, and do me thc lionour to drink out of tny flaggon then we shall ht bons camaidde» Ecoutez, the pil grnns you talk of ainved at Agen about three month» ago, but weie persuaded to stop here foi a month, loi the rams set in veiy violently, and so they did stop, and they hired a cottage just in this ntigh bouihood, and there they had lish of me in great quantities 1 pltdţre you , is not that excellent ' Well, «is I was saying, they had sueh quantities ol (ish of rmv- there are vtiy line lish in the Garonne, and I have 1 wo boats Well, but as I was saying, they had so much fish of me—
14
and at last the lady was taken in lu bour, and she died quite broken hearted at the cruelly of her husband , and thi child did not die—so I used to go and see her, pooi soul, before she died you know , for her husband, as I hint ed, behaved very ill to her, and left hei for days and days together, and at last he never came back, and she, like a fool as she was, took it so to hcait that she died Well, there was—" " Had they no attendants » ' said An thony, the man whose shrewdne^o hud discovered that Marteau was worthy of being their accomplice " Oh qu'oui t replied the fisheiman " but they soon got sick of their dreary life and one by one they fled and, at last, there was no one left but an old woman, who, in despair, drowned her self" " But where is the child? ' said one ofthe villains ' Why," resumed Mar teau, looking all round, as if to see
15
there were no listeners, "as I have quite enough to do to keep my old dame, I— s — sold it to a travelling man, and '.it took it with him into Italy I have since heard that the master, who was called Perdu, was gone into Spain to join the Moors The Holy Virgin protect us—what a sm that is! And now, my good friends, if you could but stay one night in my humble rool, to morrow I will take you to the house they lived in , and more than that, will shew you all about this country, and point out to you our curio"" convent " Well, my good fellow, ' said Ugo lino, who was at first unwilling to coin municatc with the old man, " I believe, after all, we may trust you, that s the very family wc wanted, and there s a piece of gold for you, and if you will but oblige us further, by telling us how we may get sight of one of the nuns'' " Get sight of one of the nuns I—wby
16
nobody ever sees them, waking or sleep mg, replied Marteau, with «ook» ol astonishment " I know bettor than thdt, rejoined the man, " for ont of our companions climbed tht garden «all, and saw them all and more than that, ht bribed—but it is no constqucntc lo you to know what he did I have a letter to one ot them, a Sister Frances »he is called —and I must delivti it into her own hands ' Let mc see, s«ud Mai teau, pausing —" the day aftei to morrow is a great holiday at thc convent, and a numbei ol visiter» will airive fiom all parts to pay their devotion to the image of the Viigin—and il you could make your selves look a little moie like gentlemen, not quite so fieicc —I have it, put on л pilgrims habit, and join the caval cade Slip a piece of gold mto tin- hand of the poiteiess, and whisper in her ear that you have a letter to deliver,
17
of thc greatest importance, into Sistei Frances own hands " Why thou art an adept in intrigue, replied the villain, ' we 11 e en accept thy offer, and if we can effect this, thou shalt be called the Prince of Knaves— then off to Spam in a twinkling, after this renegado knight I had some few qualms of conscience when I first began this undertaking, but they are all lulled to sleep now, since Richard Ravenspur has turned Moor, like a Moor let him be treated " Let s drink to our success, old Mar teau and thou shalt go halves in the spoils ' Well, well, the sun sinks fast, said the old man, ' let s bend our steps home ward, and as I have a son and daughtei and two grandchildren living with me besides my old dame, you 11 excuse being quite so well accommodated as I could wish—but at any rate you shall have plenty of good fish, and some wine
18
of as fine a flavour as any in Gascony I 11 lead the way." Marteau setoff, catrying his net upon the end of a long fishing-pole, taking particulai care to keep as near the river as he could. As they proceeded, he pointed to an old ruinous castle, which hung on a beetling cliff on the opposite side of thc river, and then quickened his step3 —" Holla! master," exclaimed one of his companions, " why, what makes you walk so fast? Deuce take the man ! why I, who am some twenty years younger than yon, can't keep up with you !" Stili Marteau kept on, till he had gained some distance; be then threw himself at the foot of a tree, and de¬ clared he was quite out of breath.— " So am I, ' resumed the first villain, " what could make your old limbs so nimble?" " I will tell you when we reach home, but don 't mention the subject
19
here Oh, that I had reached the hut- as sure as fate, we shall be pursued What, is yon castle the resort of ban ditti' said Ugolino, the first villain, his countenance kindling as he spoke, and drawing neam the waters edge, as it to take a more distinct view of it " By my truth and if it were not so near thy dwelling twere a good place now for such a purpose "— " Banditti, said Marteau shudder- mg^—' No, no—woise than that—'tis haunted— " Ah ' interrupted Anthony, turning pale—" I care not how many Ime men I encounter, >ut St Paul defend me from all ghosts What" said his companion Ugo lino, who was an Italian, and with л look of the most profound contempt— ' You are afraid, are you? Anthony drew his sword, and in «tantly attacked lus fellow, while Mar teau stood by, entreating them to desist
so
yet praying all the while that they might kill each other, and thus relieve lnm from from all Ins anxiety But Ugolino was coiytent with parrying the thrusts of his opponent, and at length said, " Put up your sword, Anthony, wc have somewhat else to do than to kill each other,—come, come, I did not mean to offend you—I know you are brave as a lion in the day light, and you are not the first brave man who has fearlessly faced a whole army of sol dien, and yet has trembled at his own shadow in the moonshine It is your infirmity, I know you cannot help it but for a bag of gold, I would sleep there m that castle alone, in spite ot all the spirits of the other world " Anthony surlily held out his hand— and they once more resumed their jour ney As they drew near the fisherman s hut, they heard two voices chanting tht evening hymn " Tıs my son Philip and his wife," said the fisherman, " tt»
21
their usual custom it keeps up a good name, and people buy our fish because —we are—hypocrites ι —So the world wags " Holla' Philip, leave your chaunting, and welcome our guests Here, lad, give us a stool a piece and do you, Madeline, dress us some fish Is my old wife a bed ' " Yes, father, replied Philip " and fast asleep —Who arc tlieie gentlemen ? They look brave, and fine too— " Don t be a prating fool, but get us a flask from—you know where and let us have it with no more ado These are hard times , for what with Edward theBlack Prince, and Henry the Bastard, and Peter the Cruel, and the chevalier Bayard, and all their host of knights— or robbers, if you please—it is well we can get a drop of wine to drink —Come, Madeline, be quick —and now, my good sirs, what do you intend to do till the day after to morrow? ' " Why, replied Ugolino, " you can
22 give us a row over the river but be sure the sun shines, or Anthony will have a shaking fit Now, by our Lady of Loretto, he looks pale at the bare men tion of this expedition So here 's to the perilous undertaking—Nay, nay, An thony, don 't look so serious— While Ugolino was thus speaking, Philip re turned with a flaggon of wine, and the fisherman changed the conversation, but Ugolino, who delighted exceedingly in exciting the fear of his companion, and jesting at his expense, every now and then renewed the subject which was adroitly changed by Philip—for he had no wish that an affray of any kind should take place at his hut, lest they should get into disgrace with their neighbours—but Ugolino persevered till the supper was ended, when Marteau proposed they should retire to rest " Not without the story of the ghost," said the provoking Italian " No, by Jupiter, old Marteau, since that's your
23
name I'll not stir a peg till I have heard all the horrors of that same ter¬ rific castle ful'y detailed Go to bed, Anthony, go to bed I am sure thy heart beats, Heaven help us—" he con tinued, placing his hand on Anthony's heart—" it thumps like—the—great— bell—of—the—" Anthony struggled with Ugolino, and interrupted the con¬ clusion of this tauntmç speech, and they both rolled over upon the floor together Philip, however, and his fa¬ ther, partly by force, partly by argu ment, compelled them to desist, pro¬ mising, if they would bi>t be quiet, to give them the account they wanted " Stir up the fire, Philip," added the old man, " and give us some more wine You, Madeline, go to bed, child —and be sure we have plenty of fish in thc morning for breakfast ' Madeline with drew, and Ugolino and Anthony ha/ing, at the request of the old fisherman, de posited their swords and short daggen

in a press of the kitchen, he began thc lollowing talc* after having drank off more wine, to clear his voice as he said, ' You must know, my good Idlows, that John, King of Arragon in Na varre, had one son and two daughters the name of the former I forget, but the eldest daughter was called Blanche and the younger Leonora, thc lat ter afterwards married the Count St Foix The son dying before his father Blanche became heuess appaient to tht Navarrois crown She was exceedingly beautiful, exceedingly amiable, and very generally beloved But the most extra ordinar,) part of the business was this, that her father, before he died, sent her to her younger sister Leonora, know ing that princess to be of a most am
23
bilious disposition Leonora, therefore, having thus got Blanche into her power, confined her unfortunate sister in that castle , and there Using, in vain, every possible means to make her relinquish her light to the crown, she resolved on imprisoning the unhappy princess for lite In thc dungeons of thc castle I pointed out to you, she lingered many year», and at length died suddenly, poi soncd, as it is supposed, by the base Leonora The latter now became Qneen of Navarre, and for a time she feigned the greatest grief for the death of her sister but after keeping up thc farce lor some time, she left the castle, and did not return to it for many years When she came back, she was quite an altered woman, her spirits were gone, and she appeared to be haunted by some imaginary being, and her servant said she came to the wrong place to find re¬ pose, for. at the castle, the ghost of the Lady Blanche met her whenever she ι ol in с

was alone, in the most pitiable form, clad in the remains of her former robea of dignity, but these appearing tattered and torn, her person wasted, her cheeks sunken, and her eye hollow, while with her thm extended hand pointing to the Lady Leonora, she would utter a piercing shriek, and exclaim, ' Twas thou that didst it In despair, at lengh, the Lady Leonora threw herself into the Garonne, and was drowned, and now her spirit, clothed in dripping gar¬ ments, haunts the castlo, pursued by that of the Lady Blanche, shucking ' Τ was thou that didst it Then ll.e one seems precipitating hor»elf into the Garonne, while the other vanishos into empty air I have seen them many times, and—Philip, trim thc lamp— and once, as I was concealed in thc thicket, every limb shaking with fear, they skimmed the surface of the water I fled, but they pursued me, even to this very spot —Anthony turned palo
as Marteau pointed to the middle of his kitchen, and Philip, dissembling fear, looked around yet Ugolino remained unmoved, and, «ith a sarcastic smile, asked Marteau, if the ghost had hurt lnm ' For my part, he continued, I repeat it,—if Marteau will lend his boat, I 11 sleep there to night I never loved nor feared a living woman, and its much if I should fear the ghosts of a hundred, but it s time to rest give me my swoid and dagger, Marteau, and I 11 protect you and this courageous Anthony from all the ghosts in Christendom Holla' Philip, my lad, what, arc you asleep '— give us a truss of straw and more wood, and you, old Marteau, creep to your old woman as we are stiangers heie, and may possibly be interiuptcd by more substantial ghosts than the ladies you have just descnbed, give us oui arms There, now come what will we aie prepaied Good night to you old c2

Anthony was thoroughly convinced that the fisherman was a trusty knave; his countenance, as he had before observed, bespoke с 3
30
fidelity Ugolino, who was a traitor himself, was not so ready to give per feet credence upon so doubtful a sub ject, upon which he expressed himself thus " You are so mighty confident Anthony, but I have still my suspicions lespecting this old Marteau ' Ah, replied his companion ' you are truly a man of much penetration but I shall take my nap, and you may watch if you like If you want my help, wake me—that s all Good night to you Ugolino Anthony having enveloped himself in his cloak more closely, supported his head with one hand, while the other grasped his sword Ugolino leaned back against the wall for some time, with his eyes fixed on the fire, which ever and anon he roused All was, how ever, so still around him, that he began to imagine he too might indulge him self with a little sleep He was weary, and his eyes mechanically closed, but

he unfastened the door which led to the only stair of the cottage—called upon Marteau, who answered him ; and in a short time the fisherman and his son de¬ scended ; they were soon followed by Madeline and the old woman." " Heard ye no noise last night?" in¬ quired Ugolino, fixing his penetrating eyes upon those of Madeline. "No,"she immediately replied, " none at all. I hope you have slept well, and not been disturbed : sometimes the wind whirls round the clirT, and sweeps just with such a rushing noise, that it is liko the waters of the Garonne when vexed by storms ; but last night was so still, that I heard nothing stir." " Nor I," said Marteau ; " but, my friend, did you?" " I did," was the reply, " and am certain I was not deceived.

49
even confide in you. I shall dilapidate that cottage. I know not what story your father will make out ; but I must take every precaution ; some of the pea¬ sants may describe its inhabitants, and thus betray us ; it were well, therefore, that it should appear as uninhabited for some time past. As soon as I have seen my master's child in safety, I'll return with old Le Blanc, and begin the work of desolation ; and if you can, Philip, do come there to-night, that we may know how matters stand. It must be Le Blanc's task to carry provisions to my master and his lady ; but how came Marteau to separate the child from its mother?" " Why the reason is very plain," said Madeline, " its cries in the cave would betray them; but in the village, no one will notice them. Ah, Monsieur Jaques, let us begone, for I am all in a trem¬ ble till I get back. This is a strange world we live in."
ÍO
" Don't stand parleying here," said Philip, " but make haste and perform your errand, Madeline ; and then return quickly." As they passed the cottage, Jaques sighed deeply, and seeing Robert, he called to him, and told him what had happened, and what he was to do. '* I have no time for long speeches ; but do you send the women to the village, and begin to do what I tell you :—destroy that neat little shrubbery, and pull down the honeysuckle that wantons round the old oak. I 'U be with you tuon; but the quicker you work the better. I can stay no longer—the boy wakes, Madeline,—hush him." Madeline hushed the child,' and soothed him, so that he did not cry, and having deposited him safely in the arms of Louise, she tripped home as fast as she could; while Jaques went in search of Le Blanc, and told him Monsieur Perdu wanted him immediately. As
51
they walked to the cottage, he explained to thc peasant, their present danger; and Le Blanc, with a sigh, saw that the external part ofthe cottage was already disfigured ; the inside had shared thc same fate ; and just at the door they met the two female servants, with weeping eyes, each loaded with her wearing apparel. Their hearts were too full to allow them to speak; and Jaques having told them Louise would give them a lodging for the night, they departed. While Jaques, Le Blanc, and Thomas, were busily employed in dilapidating the premises which they had taken so much pleasure in cultivating for their lord and lady, we shall attend to the wanderings of the exiled Karl and Countess of Ravenspur. As they proceeded rapidly along, they soon lost all sound, except that of the rustling of the trees and the distant hill of the waters of the Garonne. The path
52
gradually became narrower, till it was impossible for two to walk abreast; and it was with difficulty that Geraldine trod the mazy, thorny path before her. Yet she murmured not, because she felt not the incon¬ veniences which surrounded herself im¬ mediately—her thoughts were with her boy. The deepest dejection marked her beautiful countenance. At length they came to a small opening, on one side of wliich rose a perpendicular rock, overhanging the Garonne: the lower part was surrounded by brushwood, and Thomas, having groped about for some time, found the bushes yield a little to his pressure. Stooping down, he removed them at the bottom, and creeping in, he found a sort of path ; which winding about in a ïigzag direc¬ tion, was at length terminated by two or three bundles of fagots. Upon remov¬ ing these, he discovered an arched door¬ way cut in the rock. Fearlessly he
«53 entered: and ascending gradually a narrow passage, the ascent of which was rendered easy by a rude sort of stair ; he arrived at another door ; and then, to his great surprise, he entered a cave, about twelve feet square, and nine high. The roof was covered with stalactites, and the light and air were admitted by two or three uncouthly-shaped holes, cut in the rock; which, from the outside, resembled some of those casual frolics of nature, with which she occasionally delights to sur¬ prise and delight mankind. The viewfrom these apertures was beautiful: extending across the Garonne, and commanding the haunted castle and its romantic and wild vicinity. There was a kind of rude shutter attached to each of these windows, which could thus at pleasure be closed. From the roof was suspended an iron lamp ; and in one corner was a rude straw mattress, over which hung a small shelf; and upon a table was n 3
34
placed a rosary, a crucifix, and a small cresset ; two stumps of trees served as seats. No other convenience was found in this secluded spot; but as safety, not ease, was the desideratum of our travel- lers.Thomas was delightedat the security which this retreat presented to his lord and lady. Just as he was leaving this apartment, he espied another aperture, and entering it, he discovered a smaller cave, containing some few articles of household stuff, but all of an inferior cast: he staid not, however, to examine further, but hastened down the narrow passage, and informed Ravenspur that he had succeeded in discovering the cave they were in search of. " My lady will, however, have some difficulty," he added, " getting through the brush¬ wood, as I fear we must not .cakitaway; but when once she has passed it, the cave will be a delightful retreat for her.' Geraldine passively followod her hus¬ band, and entered the cave with feelings
55
of gratitude, for such an asylum, mingled with regret that her boy was not to share it with her. " My dear Geraldine," said Raven¬ spur, " I am convinced that old Marteau is our friend, and that Richard is safe. His cries here would betray us, and then one common ruin would involve us : be composed, my love, and let us retum thanks to that Power which has pointed out to us a hiding-place, in this our distressful situation." The lady Geraldine smiled ; and, as she was weary from her late exertion, Ravenspur took off his cloak, as did also Thomas, and spread it over the rude mattress for her. Thomas now retired, while the lady threw her weary limbs upon the humble bed ; and Ravenspur, seated by her side, tenderly soothed her fears, and composed her spirits.— Overcome by so many harassing circum¬ stances, her oppressed nature yielded to d 4
56
the influence of the drowsy god, and she sunk into a calm and sweet sleep. It was not so with Ravenspur ; twice in his life it had been his lot to shelter himself in the midst of wilds and soli¬ tudes. Once in the Apennines, and then it was in company with the lady Victorine, who was now at rest, whose aching head had ceased to beat, whose throbbing heart now throbbed no more. Then came the question—from whence did her sorrows spring? from Raven¬ spur. He feared 'twas so. " And thou, thou loveliest of thy sex," he added, as he gazed upon his sleeping wife, " from whence do all thy griefs proceed? alas! from Ravenspur. I am doomed to be the bane of all that love me ; and yet, my Geraldine, gladly would I sacrifice any thing, every thing, my life, to give thee peace. It may not be :—thy fate is linked to mine, and happy or miser¬ able thine must be the same. My boy
57 too, that should have been nursed in the lap of tenderness, owes, perhaps, his life to thc casual love of strangers." While Kavenspur mused thus aloud, the tedious hours glided on, and no one came ; yet still the lady slept, while her lord now paced the cave with hur¬ ried steps, now gazed from the aper¬ tures upon the distant shore ; the sun at length set, and the full-orbed moon, rose like a ball of fire, and illumed the lovely view. Ravenspur watched its progress with harmonized feelings ; and now it reached its height, which threw its pale beams across the cave, and, falling on the tall form of Ravenspur, gave to it somewhat of an unearthly ap¬ pearance, At this moment the lady Geraldine opened her eyes, and the first object which struck upon her ima¬ gination was, that the being before her was the spirit of her lord. She moved not, neither did she speak, till Raven¬ spur, who had not seen his lady awake, d5
58
turned round, she then sprang from her couch, and rushed towards him, ex churning—" Alas, my love, wouldst thou believe thy Geraldine so weak'' She thought thou wert but the shadow of thyself 1 Oh, my loved lord, thus to feel thy presence is bliss indeed How long Ive slept, and such a dream I had, well, no matter twas but a dream, No tidings yet of Marteau or my boy t Alas, the hours move slowly Midnight must be fast approaching As she spoke, Ravenspur pointed to a little boat, which gliding rapidly along, took the direction of their rock and now it put to land, and one of the men it contained leaped on shore " 'Tıs Philip, said Ravenspur, ' and Le Blanc It was, indeed, Philip, who had got out of the cottage window, at a signal given by La Blanc who had brought provisions and some warm covering for the lady Geraldine Philip having
59
moored his little boat, gave his hand to Le Blanc, and they immediately pro ceeded to empty it of its contents, carry¬ ing their articles, apparently, in the opposite direction to the brushwood re treat Le Blanc followed him, and Ra venspur saw them no more, till they entered through the second apartment where Thomas had stretched himself upon the hard rock, and sunk into a profound sleep Le Blanc having rested himself a few minutes, bade Philip deposit what he had broughtinthe cave, and then be off " Per haps you may be missed, for that Ugo¬ lino, by your account, is of a very sus¬ picious nature I will tell Monsieur Perdu all that has passed—away, awaj ' Philip having paid his ıespects to Ravenspur and his lady, descended through the circuitous passages with great swiftness, enteied his little boat, and rowing with all his might, he was soon out of sight Having reached d6
60 home in safety, he pushed his light bark among some sedges, and made for the cottage Unluckily his foot slip¬ ped, just as he reached the window, and he slid again to the ground, and this mishap produced the noise which had roused Ugolino , he was more for¬ tunate in his second attempt, and gained the entrance without any farther accident What immediatelv followed, the reader is well acquainted with When Le Blanc and Themas had spread forth, their stores, and that Ra venspur and Geraldine had refreshed themselves, Le Blanc informed them of the dilapidation of their cottage, of the good health of Richard, and of the resolution of Marteau, to save them or perish with them " I do not know a more sagacious man in the whole ham let than Marteau, ' he added, " and he has as much courage as e er a youth for twenty miles round besides which, he is so cool and collected, and so pe-
ы
netratiiig, that I warrant him, ho 11 outwit twenty such fellows as Ugolino, knave as he is I did not let Jaques come with me to night, nor Robert, be¬ cause the fewer that arc here the bet¬ ter, for Marteau sent word, that he sliould not make any attempts to see ine, if by so doing he should excite their suspicions As I have not seen him, I suppose he finds a little diffi¬ culty in manœuvring I have brought you provision for two days, and I would advise you, on no account to venture below " But, ' said Ravenspur, " are we safe here, since there are two entrances to this cave ' ' " It is impossible any one should find it out," replied Le Blanc, " unless m formed of it before The way in which Philip discovered this was from seeing a boat row to it, from which two men leaped, and lifting something weighty from lt, which they carried towards
62
the rock He saw them push back a stone, and then disappear for a time boon after which they again emerged, and leaping into the little vessel, soon moved out of sight Philip had the courage, when they were gone, to en¬ ter also, and there he discovered, in a room beloiv, the parcel they had de¬ posited , he opened it, and found it con tamed money and jewels, gold and silver cups, and much treasure This then was the place of retreat of a set of robbers, who had for some time in fested this neighbourhood What does Philip do' but he ciams his pockets full of the gold pieces He then took two of the large cups, and Iastened them to a tree near at hand, removed the stone entirely, and what he could not carry off he buried in the vicinity The next night he returned, accompa med by old Marteau, and they con cealed themselves At the same hour the boat landed but the fellows no
03
sooner saw tht stone removed, and the gold cups hung up, than they burned back to the river, embarked, and rowed off in grtat haste From that time to this the neighbourhood has been no longer infested by the gang of robbers who used to molest and pilfer travellers Philip was only fifteen when he did this good foi hisfellow-creatures,andMaiteau forbade his mentioning the circumstance to any one And when I came to night I knew not of the mode of en trance, though I have often admired thc spot You need, therefore, be under no appiehension, and, I trust, that to nioi low evening you will bc at liberty to ictuin to youi pretty cottage We sliall soon put it in order for you —" No, said Kavenspur, " Good Le Blanc, 1 shall never find rest on L hi atum ground, I shall seek an asylum among the Moor» there I have a friend who is able to protect me When Madame has reco vered her strength and spints we will
64
travel to Bourdeaux, and there embark for Spain —Good sir," interrupted Le Blanc, " do not leave us, you will no where find warmer friends than those who are now so anxious for your safety ' " The life of apprehension,'' re turned Ravenspur, " is of all others the most exhausting The mind becomes weak from a frequent recurrence of evil It sees danger where there is none, and the falling of a leaf, when I am beside Madame and my boy, startles me I can no longer endure this life of apprehen sion, my soul spurns the fears I am compelled to acknowledge , and I pro test to you, Le Blanc,' continued Ra¬ venspur, his eye kindling as he spoke, that were it not for those dear objects of my love, I would this instant face twenty villains of the stamp of Ugolino But when I think of her forlorn condi tion, should I fall By heavens I am a very coward " Ravenspur paced the cave, and his fine countenance strongly
63
portrayed the anguish of his soul Ge¬ raldine rose, and taking one hand withm hers, the other resting on his shoulder, she said, " Oh my—" a look from her lord silenced her, and her head sunk upon his shoulder " Droop not thus, my love, all will yet be well, thou will not fail to see us to morrow night, my good old friend,' cont/nued Ravenspur," addressing Le Blanc, " we shall await thy coming with much im patience ' " If possible,' returned Le Blanc, " I will be with you Yet, dear lady, do not think it strange if I should not appear till the morning following , for to morrow is the grand festival at the convent, the town is full of pilgrims, and I may be detained by many causes But see, the morning dawns, the faint streak of day begins to gild the moun tain top Thomas can kindle your lamp, your fire there is plenty of charcoal, and I have brought you oil yet see you do

" He comes not," said Geraldine, as she watched the progress of a scene like that described above. " He comes not, my Ravenspur. Oh, kind Heaven ! de¬ fend my boy. It must be midnight, sure —Hark ! what noise was that — Alas! 'twas but the wind sweeping round the rock.—Look out again, dear Ravenspur, canst thou discern nought?" " Nothing, my love," replied hei lord, " as yet; your anxiety prolongs the hours ; it cannot be near the time he came last night; retire, my love, the

69
lustily, while Ugolino, smiling sarças tically, said the noise came from the opposite side of the river " But it is no matter," he continued " Ah, what a noble rock, that it is , by Saint Peter, I should expect to see banditti in that wild solitude I shall mark this place , it may be useful, if we meet this Ravenspur stone rocks tell no tales — Give me the oars, Marteau, you are weary I must reach Orthes to night, to morrow I hope we sliall be half way over the Pyrenees I have had secret intelligence where this said gentleman ts to be found Ah, old Marteau, you are a sly old fox, hut they cheated you I can tell you, when you thought this gentleman we are m search of was over the hills and far away, he was close to you What do you thmk of that, man » hidden, I tell you, and concealed close to your own home But I 11 unkennel him before the day rises and sets again

CHAP. IV. I know tby strength, and thou know'st mine, Neither our own, but gtv'n , whnt folly then To boait what arms emt dot since thine no more Than hcav'n permits, nor mine, though doubled now To trample thee as mine for proof look up, And read thy lot ш yon celcBtial sign, Where thou art weigb'd, and shewn how light, bow weak, If thou resist Milton But the particulars of thc nocturnal expedition of the spies sent in search of Ravenspur and his family must now be detailed. About eleven o'clock of the night, Ugolino proposed to Marteau to com¬ mence their expedition ; and they having each enveloped himself in a pilgrim's dress, and put on the hat with the scal¬ lop fixed in the front, proceeded with •cautious steps towards the rock.
72
" In good truth, ' said Ugolino, " I never felt so little inclination for any expedition, as I do for this I would rather meet twenty men than one nun, and my lady moon, too, seems to shew her broad face as if to interrupt our rport So, Marteau, I say, my good fellow, how beats your pul»e » There appear to be some stragglers about— ' ' The more the better, ' replied Mar teau, " for then we shall be less con spicuous·' Ugolino strode on first, and gaining the summit of the rock, looked cau tiously around At one angle of the garden wall stood an aged pilgrim, en veloped in a long brown russet robe He beckoned Ugolino, and drawing him on one side, said, " You are in search of Ravenspur go to the haunted castle there you will find him " By my troth, I guessed it might be so, replied Ugolino , " but friend, I say, stop But the pilgrim, turning suddenly round thc
73
angle, fled with considerable speed, and Ugolino missed him without peiceiving which way he went After some little search, the latter returned out of breath to his companions, but refused to explain thc cause of his absence Anxiously he listened for the nuns signal, and after waiting some time, a womaii s voice said, " Hist ' hist ' Ugolino — ıs it you ι Marteau's anxiety now exceeded ■iny thing he had ever felt in his life before " Don't be incautious, good fellow, said he, " let her speak again, she may be a spy '* Hist ! hist ' ' again was heard—" I have but a moment to stay' " Lady," said Ugolino in the Italian tongue, " what is your name ' ' Sister Frances," was thc reply, " the friend of Angelina Countess of Raven spur' " The very person I— " Haik, said Marteau, interrupting hmi, " I hear footsteps, and see, Ugolino, a pilgrim
74
approaches. I must begone : I tremble like an aspen leaf." " No, by Jupiter, you leave us not, Marteau," resumed the Italian, " thou shalt stay and share our fate.—Lady, lady," he added, " I have a letter— how can I give it you ?" " Tie a stone to it," said Anthony, " and fling it over the wall." " Thou art used to this sport, then," rejoined Ugolino ; " thou hast, I sup¬ pose, found favour in the eyes of some pretty nun, maugrc thy ugly face.— Come, be quick." The letter was thrown over, and now Marteau thought all was indeed at an end; for that letter contained particular questions, the answers to which would unravel his whole plot. Yet he resolved to make a desperate effort, if possible, to elude the discovery : feigning, there¬ fore, the utmost delight at the progress of their plot, he stopped suddenly short, listened attentively, and drew Ugolino
75

The nun had indeed said tn the mean while, that ' Ravenspur s wife and child were with him, and that he (Ugolino) was desired by his employ crs to secure all the persons of their household " The cottage, she con tinued, ' is but a few minutes walk from hence, and the person is called Perdu— ' There now, said Marteau, " did I not tell you all this ' " Can 't you be quiet, rejoined Ugo lino, as the nun continued thus " The best time to surprise them is the night ' Ah ' said Ugolino, " but they are fled, and we cannot trace their steps " Indeed '" said the nun, with the tone ofsurpnse, "Gone'when?—where' Ah now I think of it, Madame was not at mass last night nor yet this morning " " Was she then so lately in this neigh bourhood' inquired Ugolino, anxiously " In truth she was, and must still be concealed some where in this vt
77
cinity Come nearer, Ugolino Is any one with you ? ' " Friends," he- replied, " are you sure they are such' I have heard that the fisherman and they were intimate I would advise you to be upon your guard " Marteau could stand this no longer, but advancing close to the wall, he said, " Ugolino, there arc a company of pilgrims at the foot of the hill, I see them through the trees At this moment, too, the nun ex claimed, " Ah, mon Dieu, je suis per due" Anthony, at these words, ran as fast as he could down the hill, and Marteau followed htm at an equal pace, notwtth standing all Ugolino s efforts to prevent them When they got to the level ground, Ugolino oiertook them "Pretty fellows you are, truly, to leave one in the lurch m this w ay Why, 1 have not half done my errand yet I was to have received orders from the nun e 3
78
" Ah, ' replied Anthony, " she ıs, I dare say, receiving orders herself by this time, poor soul I wľ>h I could have hauled her over the wall Why, I dare say she '11 be immured in somr dismal cell for the next twelvemoiuh at least, if not buried alive " " It is confoundedly unlucky," ob served Ugolino, as he slowly followed Marteau and Anthony " I don't quite comprehend these contradictory reports Ah! who 's there'—what! the pil grim again ' Speak, what hast thou to ьау'' " I have a friend tn the convent, and I understand from her, whom I have just seen at the portal, that a nun is put into confinement, and that no pilgrim will be admitted to day to see the holy image" "Who are you' said Ugolino, peering under the large flapped hát of the pilgrim I have proved myself thy friend,' ieplied the incognito " make me not
79
thy foe by suspecting me of being so I have no more to say " The pilgrim was moving quickly off, but Ugolino stretched out his powerful arm, and detained him " You go not yet, good sir, said the Italian, " I have some few questions to ask, which you must answer How came you to know that I was in search of Raven spur' and how is it that you should know the place of his retreat' This spot appears to me inhabited by phan toms Dost hear' We part not till I know thee better A slight attempt was made by the stranger to extricate his arm from the grasp of Ugolino, but the effort was use¬ less " It is in vain, ' said the latter, ' you cannot escape, nor shall you go till I am satisfied The pilgrim now stood still, and in a low voice said, " Who I am, or what I am, imports thee not, but it perhaps concerns thee, as much as it does me, E 4s
80
that thou shouldst loose my arm. I am within call of help, if thou dost persist in detaining me : thou art alone." " You are mistaken, friend," replied Ugolino, " I am not alone ; I have a trusty friend here," he continued, put¬ ting his hand within his cloak, and drawing from beneath it a stiletto.— " Beeides, there are two studry fellows at but a short distance, who would soon disperse twenty of thy friends." The unknown pilgrim was exceed¬ ingly uneasy in his present situation, and knew not how to extricate himself from his dilemma. Chance, however, befriended him ; he struggled hard to release himself, and though by no means a match for the Italian, yet the latter was compelled to put forth a portion of his strength, and in the struggle his large hat fell off, and exposed a countenance but ¡11 according with the humble cloak lie wore. Anthony happened at this moment to look upwards, and seeing
81
the scuffle, he seized hold of Marteau s urm, exclaiming, " By Jupiter, Ugolino is attacked, and ш an instant he was by the side of his companion Marteau followed By this time, one or two pit gnms approached the spot, when An thony approaching Ugolino, said, " Ait mad, thus to exhibit that black face ol thine to the gaze of strangers ' What, in the name of wonder, is the matter ' " Ugolino made no reply , but letting go the arm of tht stranger, hastily picked up his hat, and surlily left the spot—looking back, howevei, repeat edly at his opponent, who leisurely turned round the corner of the convent wall " He is a spy," said Ugolino musing, " I am suie he is Would I could havt throttled the villain " You did wisely then, supposing lnm such, to shew thy grim vi sage Why, Ugolino, man, thou hast lost thy wits, and since thou hast e5

83 to the right about, and wc may whittle for the gold " " We must give old Marteau the slip then, replied Ugolino, " he shall see us to Orthes, and there we will take leave of him for a time But we must dissemble with him—holla · Marteau — whither so quick '' Marteau pretended not to hear, but continued his pace till Anthony overtook him —" I say. Mar teau, why so fast, my man ' ' " I want my supper, ' replied the fisherman , " and I was hastening on to hurry Madeline with the fish —But come you along with me, leave old Ugolino to his own gloomy meditations he seems thoughtful, I think What is the matter with him' " He wants a flask of your wine to cheer his spirits," was the reply — He shall have it, and welcome to«) said Marteau "Holla!

86
forgotten, and, as the villains quaffed heartily thc luscious wine, which Mar teau produced, they became merry sung several songs, and would have tarried till the morning, had not Philip reminded them of the monks Had the fisher man named the officers of justice, Ugo¬ lino would have kept his seat, but both, he and Anthony had the utmost dread at falling into the hands of the church, which was at this period exercising many cruelties towards the Albigenses, and all who protected or sheltered these unhappy people They therefore started from then seats, and having given Marteau some pieces of gold, they leaped into the boat, which soon rowed out of sight of the hut—but not before Philip declared he saw the Dominican upon the shore, bending his steps towards his now peace iul home Nothing but subjects of an ordinary kind were discussed as they proceeded,
87 till the shriek from the rock arrested their attention nor did any thing par tıcular occur till they reached Orthes There they took leave of Marteau, inti mating that he might perhaps see them again, when the Dominicans had finished their council Marteau and Philip, having taken a parting cup with them, rowed back to the rock as fast as they were able, but they did not reach it till mid-day Ugolino, m the mean while, remained very quietly at Orthes that day, making inquiries as to the monks, and the num ber of strangers who had passed through that town lately A family was de scribed to him, which he thought must be that of Ravenspur yet still the pil¬ grim had affirmed, that his intended victim was concealed in the haunted castle Reports were, in fact, so con trary, that he knew not what plan to adopt, particularly as Anthony posi tively refused to accompany lnm to the

Castle ш question " He wou'd rather, he said, " face the monks than the ghosts, and Ugolino began to imagine tliat it would be the wiser plan to pro ceed immediately into Spam He had been teased and he feared deceived, by Marteau, who might have detained lum at his hut for the sole purpose of giving Ravenspur time to advance so lar on his journey, that he might thus elude his pursuers Having, therefore, hired mules and a guide he set out on tht following morning for Bayonne, on his fruitless errand, in the performance of which we shall leave him and his worthy companion At the convent all was a scene ol confusion, for Le Blanc, having put on a pilgrim s habit, gave intelligence to tht Lady Abbess, that one of her nuns had made an assignation with a pilgrim at the garden wall, and that the safety of the family she valued for old acquaint ance sake depended upon counteracting,
89
if not preventing, this interview Thc abbess immediately summoned all her nuns around her, and gave positive or ders to the porteress to close the gates an hour before the usual time , she also commanded the nuns to retire instantly to their cells, although this was a great festival, which was generally celebrated in the evening by sociality and a relaxa¬ tion from the rules of the house A look of disappointment was stronglyexpressed by every countenance, but each nun in silence withdrew, y et Sister Frances le¬ solved on making an attempt, which she effttted by means of bribery She gave her gold cross to the porteress, and eagerly ran through the garden walks till she reached the most accessible part of the wall The Lady Abbess did not retire to rest—and the porteress, having heard her superior walk hastily up and down her apartment, ran foi the nun, and her
90
arrival caused the daring sister to make the exclamation of " Je suis perdue ' At the door of entrance she and the porteress were met by the abbess who instantly ordering them to enter her par lour, she fastened them in, and then summoned the whole of her family around her Having explained the na ture of the sister's crime, she mercifully fixed her punishment at solitary con finement for one twelvemonth, instead of the dreadful one of being immured alive in the cell appointed for all nuns who had broken their vow in so glaring a manner The porteress was expelled for ever, and a report made of her conduct to the general of the order, who forbade her ever approaching a sacred edifice again, on pain of being confined for life in a dungeon

While these events were taking place at the hut and the convent, Ravenspur was endeavouring to cheer his lady with the hopes of better days. But the sight of Le Blanc did more to calm her agita¬ tion than all the arguments of her lord. His first words were cheeiíng: " Your boy, Lady, is well, and in safety—and ï trust by this time you yourselves may join him; yet, till we
93
see Marteau, we must not venture to quit this convenient spot " Can I not sec my boy' eagerly inquired the lady — ' Patience, my Ge raldine," said Ravenspur —" anon wc will see Marteau, and then make ar rangements for our future plans Sit down, Le Blanc, and tell us what thou knowest of the exploits of old Marteau and Philip Truly we are much in debted to thee, to lnm, to all who have thus nobly stood forward to assist strangers, and who have even ventured their lives to pitserve ours " Ah t good Le Blanc, said Geral dine, " to thee, indeed, we owe more than wc e'er can pay , and thy Louise has bten a mother to my boy Oh, how my heart pants to see him Does he pine, good Le Blanc' docs he thmk of me' " He appears restless, replied the old man, " at times, but in general is very happy—but, dear Lady, I wish

you would compose your spirits, and do now taste this wine —beiore the sun sets you shall see hitn —fear not—that Providence which has preserved you so wondeifully fiom so many threatening dangers,will,initsowngoodtime,restore you to that land for which you sigh , to that home which you so well would grace Ah, Lady ' sorrow is not con fined to high life—and though you were pleased to call me happy, and almost to say you envied me my lowly comforts, yet I have had my sorrows—but the will of Heaven be done I have had six children, Lady, yet all aie gone I have two ties left, ray Louise, and my grandchild Louisen My eldest son perished in the persecution of the Albi genses , my second died in a con sumption my third was attacked by a party of smugglers, and was killed at the age of seventeen My eldest daugh ter took the veil in the convent on the rock, and thus left me also, my second

died at an early age, and the youngest alone lived to give birth to my Louise, and then expired —thus have I, in a few words, given you a long tale of woe But I have still much to bc thankful for —though I honestly confess to you that sometimes it requires a good deal of resolution to submit to these hard trials patiently, «hen I sit solitary in my kitchen, and look back on thc years that are gone But, he conti nued, " I did not mean to dim your eye, fair Lady, I meant only to oh serve, that you alone were not af flicted " Thc tears you see thus dim my eye are tears of remorse," replied Geral dine, " oh, how selfish have I been, how ungrateful' Yet, Le Blanc, I have lost a child—for she is lost to me, and now I must relinquish aU idea of see ing her For I would not expose bei to such perils as those I have lately un dergone, no, not for the exquisite plea

sure of beholding her, of pressing her to my bosom, and hearing the en¬ trancing word mother pronounced by her rosy lips. Submission, in future, sliall mark my life, and for thy sake, my Ravenspur, thy Geraldine shall play the heroine." Hour after hour passed slowly on, and still Marteau appeared not; yet, when thc sun had gained its meridian, Geraldine, whose eyes were fixed upon thc river, fancied she saw his boat in the distance; eagerly she caught Ra¬ venspur's arm, and pointed to the ob¬ ject which had arrested her attention. Green boughs were placed on the head of the boat, and soon they could dis¬ tinguish Philip's voice, singing the fol¬ lowing stanzas : as the boat drew near they could hear him distinctly chant thc chorus : Ah, lady—lady, weep no more, The danger's past—the peril 'a o'er,
06
Soon thou shalt clasp thy baby fair, Thy heart shalt now be light as air Thy frirntts were true—thy foes are gone, They pass'd the cave at morning s dawn, They 've miss'd their prey, and now forlorn To Spain's fair clime they journey on Thy boy in safety, sees thc light, And thou shalt see him ere to-night May Heaven its blessing still extend, And grant you ne'er may want a friend, Then, lady—ladv, weep no more, The danger's past—the peril's o'er In a transport of joy, Geraldine clasped her lord in her arms and wept ; unable to support herself, he put his arm around her, while Philip, for¬ getting every thing but that they were all in safety, entered the cave, ca¬ pering about, and singing the chorus of the song, till his father followed and stopped him " The boy is mad!" said Marteau, '■ stark staring mad. Why, Philip, stop, I say. Ah' well, it is no use, I see, you must have your frolic out, I sup-
97
роэс , but if it must bo so, why even have it out on the beach " As Marteau said this, he gave Philip a push, and sent lum upon the full can¬ ter down the narrow stair Le Blanc, who was anxious to fetch little Richard, followed Philip, and when Ravenspur looked from the window, they were both seating themselves in the boat, when they had ai ranged themselves they began to row sturdily, Philip com mencing his song, while, ever and anon, he would rest his oar, and wave his hat in token of joy Ravenspur smiled as he watched them, and Geraldine, who was anxious to know what had become of Ugolino and Anthony, listened with the deepest attention to the narrative of Marteau, who had thus outwitted the intriguing Italian While she was thus engaged, she heeded not the passing time, and the fisherman seemed purposely to spin out his tale, that he might amuse hei, vol m ρ
98
and divert her thoughts from du elling on other subjects She became, at length, however, somewhat wearied by lus de tail, and began to evince an impatience, which Ravenspur seeing, asked Mar teau " What tune he should suppose it was'"—" I know not," was his reply, " but I will, with your permission, soon tell you, if you will allow mc to go be low ' At tlus moment the distant sound of oars was heard, Geraldine started from bei seat, again seated herself, while, ıı ith a faint smile, she observed she was become the child of imagination " But the voice of Philip again stole upon hei cai, and the countenance of Ravenspui \v as irradiated by smiles She had at this moment but one object, which en- giossed her thoughts, and which could make her smile She, theiefore, felt assured, that Ravenspur could not smile unless he saw her boy One glance from the window sufficed to convince
99
her that her trials were over She flew down the nairow stau, and was on the beach before the boat had ι cached the land, aud would have lushed into the river had not Ravenspur, who had lol lowed her tlostly, held her back Hti boy uas ready to spring fiom the arms of Louise, to meet the maternal em bract of Geialdine With a convulsii e pressure the lattei clasped hnn to her bosom, while his little arms closely toldtd round her neck, nearly suffocated her again and again he put his lips to heis, while loosening his grasp for one instant, he would draw his smooth little hand ovei hei velvet cheek, then agam nestle closely Tears relieved the highly wrought feelings of Geialdine, by whom Ravenspur stood silently Richard at length looktd around him, and espied his father, his little arms were stretched towards him, indeed, the child was so overwhelmed with joy, as well as its г 2
100
parents, that it scarcely knew what it did The first burst of joy having sub sided into more bearable and calm de light, Ravenspur withdrew to a short distance with Marteau and Le Blanc, and told them, that he had relinquished all idea of crossing the Pyrenees, that he should go to Marseilles, and there embaik for Barcelona, since he was very sure that his lady would never be able to enduie the fatigues of such a perilous journey, he also proposed leav mg their two female attendants behind them, trusting to the kindness of tht Lady Abbess and Le Blanc, or Marteau, to get them comfortably settled in some family, or else convey them to England While Ravenspur and Le Blanc had been thus engaged, Jaques and Philip had spread a sailcloth upon the beach, while Madeline, who had been assisted by Louise, had kindled a fire, and was
KU
dressing some fish When all was ready, thcy invited Ravenspur and his lady to paitake of their homely refresh ment, and few, perhaps, were the meals which any of the party had par taken of which seemed more sweet than this The «un was setting on the western hills ш a glow of purple and gold, the Garonne reflected the lovely tints as in a mirror, no breeze ruffled the stieam, the foliage of the opposite woods was motionless, except that of the light trembling aspen Nature seemed to have sunk into a calm as pleasing and as delightful as that which had replaced the late turmoils in the breasts of thc admiring spectators Gradually the sun disappeared, and the clear ether as sumed a sea green tint, one by one the stars appeared glittering like diamonds by degrees the sky became daiktr, till at length it assumed that distant deep ι 3

105
boat, to shore Then, whtn she was moored he assisted his lady to land, led her to the cottage, and having wished Marteau and his family good night, they retired to the room which the fisherman had insisted they should occupy during their stay in that neighbourhood Geraldine having undressed her sleep ing boy, and poured forth her heart ш prayer and praise, laid down to sleep without a single care With Raven spur and her boy by her side she had no wish on earth but one, and that related to her father One sigh for him she heaved ere she closed her eyes, then with feelings of the most peifect happiness to lull her to repose, she soon sunk into a calm and profound sleep Le Blanc and Louise, in the mean while, returned home, accompanied by Philip On their way thither, they con gratulated each other on their latt sue ess, ' For my part, ' said Philip, I г5
106
do verily believe, that this Monsieui Perdu is somebody of consequence, for «ilthough he never commands as it were yet Jaques and the servants always treat him with the most profound re spect Besides, the lady is so noble in hermanner, and so condescending, that I am sure they have seen mortal better days Well, this world is like a wheel sure enough—the top spoke to day may be grinding in the mire to morrow But what do you think Jaques says '—why he says, Le Blanc, they sliould all have been murdered, if it had not been for us, and, suie enough, that Ugolino was a terrible cut throat looking fellow They are gone, however, and so there is a good end of as bad a beginning, as ever I saw " True, ' said Le Blanc , " and now, my good Philip, since you can be dis erect I know, never, as you value your own safety, and that of all the parties concerned, never mention the cirtum
107
stances to a living soul Time may come we shall know more about Monsieur Perdu, but till then, let us not cndan gcr his life and our own, by any foolish prattle Still keep the seciet of thc cave, and although they say women must prate of all they know, Madeline and Louise will, I am sure, bc prudent, and never let a word slip which sliould betiay ought that has passed, since thtir safety, as well as ours, depends upon their fidelity " Well, well, replied Philip, " good night, Le Blanc, you may trust me, you know, though I would not bet my new fishing boat against that shooting diess of yours, that either of the women will keep the secret " " Go along, boy,' said Louise, " don't talk so of your betters, you know I can keep a secret—you know I can do you recollect the mill, Philip' she added, with an arch smile " Oh you wicked creature, replied f 6

Philip, putting his hand upon her lips ' not one word more—not another word if you love me Le Blane laughed heartily—" What ι Philip, were you caught' \h' ha' that s right, my boy, when we cant fight we can fly—ha ' ha' ha !" Philip ran home, and threw himself upon a bench at the hut door, and slept for a couple of hours then iose with the sun, and with a he »ft hght as tht mormng breeze, he roused his wife and children, the latter of whom, when dressed, he put into his boat, and rowed away across the river, for the purpose ot fishing near the castle, where lhere was always an abundance of sport

Canst thou to-night acquaint any of tlie Fathers of the adjoining monastery, that strangers would avail themselves of thc sanctuary of their confessional to un- burthen their minds, and receive absolu¬ tion?" " I will instantly repair to the con¬ vent," replied Le Blanc ; " but you cannot be admitted till the morning— this I know." " Then we must even delay our joui¬ ney for a few hours," was the reply. As soon as they could gain admittance on the following morning, Ravenspur repaired to the confessional of the C..r- melite monks, and Geraldine to that ol the nuns of the same order. It chanced that the priest who gave absolution to Ravenspur was connected with the con¬ vent, and occasionally officiated there, when the regular confessor of the con¬ vent was unable to perform his duty. No sooner, therefore, had Ravenspur, under the seal of confession, declared
113
who he was, than the monk listened at tentively to all he had to say, and having given him absolution for the past, he endeavoured to discover whither he was going, but Ravenspur, whom danger had taught prudence, eluded the inten tions of the monk, and quitted the con vent so hastily, that the latter lost sight of htm without discovering which way he went This circumstance caused him some uneasiness, and as soon as his lady had returned from performing thc same duty as that he had |ust ful filled, they entered the boat of Marteau, and quickly lost sight of the fisherman s hut On the beach stood Louise, Madelint, and Le Blanc, with eyes fixed on tht little bark, which glided rapidly on When they could no longer see it, from Ihe sudden winding of the river, they entered the hut and poured forth an ardent prayer for the safety of the exiled travellers

Marteau and Philip to the former of whom Ravenspur had explained that he had fresh cause of anxiety to quit that spot as soon as possible, rowed quickly on, and as the country on each side of the noble river was not as now, so richly cultivated, neither were its banks so much inhabited, they performed the first days journey without being the least interrupted Tivo or three fishing boats hailed them, but passed rapidly on, being more occupied with catching fish, than in troubling their heads about the pursuits of their neighbours They did not go on shore» that night but slept m their little vessel, and when they arrived at Toulouse, they took refuge in one of those houses which hav been in all ages, under different names, esta blished for thc reception of strangeis Toulouse was then more romantically situated than even in these days, foi the surrounding country was thickly wooded, and the vineyards, which now
115 ч> profusely adorn it, were but thinly scat¬ tered. Yet our travellers lingered some time in this celebrated town, as tlic Jeux Floraux were about to be celebrated. These games were instituted, some feu years beforeourstory commences, by Clé¬ mence Isaure, a beautiful Toulonaiso, whose interesting story is as follows, translated from the Fiench of Florian Thoui ouse possess ă a loveìy fair, Clémence Isaure, Alphonso's heir ,— Lantree for her with passion bum'tì, And she his vows in faith return'd Her parents stern tlus flame oppos'd, And spum'd lier wish to be espous'd Her heart, alas ' by love illum'd, W ith gnawing grief by fate 's consum'd 2 Alphons', the father of Isaure, Mark'd the grief—her bosom tore Faithful to him that she ador'd, Wuh tears her sire she thus implor'd " Without delay your anger prove, " And end my days, or bless my love,— " My life to thee, I know, belongs,

Ravenspur was no poet, yet he was re solved not to quitToulouse without being present at this ceremony The Lady Ge ¡aldine, too, he proposed, sliould be a spectatiess of the splendid scene As strangers of all countries were admitted «is competitors in these games, and as feats of arms, as well as literary exlu bittons, formed a part of the show, he desired Jaques would procure hnn л good steed, a new cloak, and a suit of plain armour, with a plain shield To the care of this trasty knave, and thai of Thomas and Robert, he intrusted his lady, who could not claim her seat of iánk without betraying moie than Itavtnspur thought prudent should be known The lovely Geraldine, there foie enveloped, so that her figure was as little conspicuous as possible, took her station among the spectators, with α heart beating with anxiety Raven spur in arms, and contending for the pnze of valour, appeared in her eyes
lâO
as he was wont, and gave to hcı own feminine form an air of dignity, which imposed on those aiound her, and gained her a front row Thc prizes of the Jeux Floraux had been bestowed upon the victors in the early part of the morning, and they appeared seated near the lady who was to distribute the reward of chivalrous merit Each of these poets exhibited in their caps the diflerent flowers they had won Several tilts had taken place before Ravenspur thought proper to enter the lists At length a Moorish champion appeared, who, mounted superbly on an Arabian courser, entered the area, dc daring by a herald, that Zemira was the fairest lady that ever graced a tour nament, and that he ivas ready to prove this assertion at the risk of his life So glaring a defiance in the presence of so many Christian ladies, was instantly answered by several knights Geral¬ dine s heart beat high, she knew her lord
121
would not allow this Moor to bear off the palm of victory without disputing it with him Successively did the stranger unhorse several of his opponents, and the ladies began to tremble for their fame, when Ravenspur, who had hi therto been a silent, but not unobserv tng spectator of all that p«issed, ad vaneed to oppose the redoubted cham pion There was something particularly interesting in this stranger, who, thus alone had entered the lists His horse was breathing hard, himself appeared shaken by the exertion, Ravenspur ap proached the herald, who seeing a kmght not clad in steel and gold, and upon an indifferent steed, scarcely deigned to attend to him Yet Raven spur s movement betrayed he was used to command, and the herald obeyed his behests, and approaching the Moorish knight delivered Ravenspui s chai lenge — Sır Knight, as thy horse is weary, and thyselt ait heated and fa SOL III о

tigucd, yon Christian Kmght, without a name, challenges thee, on the morrow to break a lance, .declaring—' that hi·. lady as far surpasses thine as light tht dark Anothei herald, in the couise of л few minutes, gave back tht answer ol the Mooi —" Tims tell yon stmngei knight, his armour, his horse, and hnn self, seem little suited to merit the meed of lady's love but that the Moorish knight sees through this rude exterior, the bearing of a noble form and mind and, therefore, will meet him on equal terms to moirow, in the same place, il so the lady Ian who İlere presides pci mit The Mooi then rode up to Raven spui, and extending his hand, he said, ' Give me thy hand, Sir Knight, and when these goodly company disperse thou shalt be my guest to night " Ah 1 exclaimed Ravenspur, stait ing " would I had heard that voice
123
belore I gave mj challenge, for, by my knighthood, its tones have cowed mj better part of man The Moor «as motionless an instant " It is now too late, Sir Knight, ' he ι cplied, " thy words aie gone forth bc fore this noble company, and honour has engraven them deeply on thy heart and mine , shame must not efface them, yet, smce thou « ouldst have it otherwise, I would it had been other «i»e too I have a sad forboding, that thou art the last good knight on earth 'gainst whom this tiusty spear would point But why does the great, tin. noble, Ra-----' " Not another syl lable, was the reply of Ravenspur, ' as you would preserve my life '— ' Indeed ' ' ejaculated the Moor, " whj then attend me home'—" There is, ieplied Ravenspur, " an anxious spec tatress of oui interview, whomustknow the upshot of my daring But I will send a trusty knave shall learn thy
124
dw elling, and when I have stilled her fears I will attend thee " During this short dialogue the lady had granted permission for the combat, and a herald proclaimed, in the usual manner, that a tournament would bc held on the morrow Geraldine had leaned anxiously for ward, and when she saw the two knights separate she seemed to breathe more freely, accompanied by her faithful at tendants, she quitted the field, and a few moment» after her arrival, she had the felicity of embracing her lord To her private ear he confided the secret of the Moorish Prince, and she wept for a time at the dangers of this en counter, the dishonour of a retreat, and of the pang that one or the other of the combatants must endure in the defeat ofhis opponent Yet, woman as she ivas, and unprotected, save by her hus¬ band s aim, she was not living in that most chivalrous age, without having
125
imbibed some of those enthusiastic feel mgs, which enabled her to convert a part ofher wardrobe into a scarf, which she promised to fasten round her hus band s arm on the morrow But from his bosom he drew forth the present of her virgin love, entwined with that of Victonne The lattei he gave to Geraldine, then told her, ' that while he lived, that scarf, which she had fondly fastened round his arm, when first he left his native land, should never be replaced by one of later date To night, my love,' he continued, I have promised to spend a few houis with my gallant friend It it it shoultl be late ere I return be not alarmed, for we have much to exchange in ' friendly converse ' ' The lady Geraldine agreed that this was true, and hastened his departure Jaques had, upon a signal from his lord followed the Moorish knight, and was by this time, waiting at the door to shew
126
him the way In the suburbs of the city he found that friend, against whom he had made his first essay of arms Some time elapsed ere they could give vent to their joy at this meeting — ' Think not of the morrow,' said young \chmet, " think only, dear Ravenspur, of communicating to me the cause of your present humble appearance " During his narrative, Ravenspur was interrupted frequently by the exclama¬ tions ol the Punce, whose indignation burst forth occasionally in language, but more frequently by sudden starts and rising, by the giasping of his swoid, and the use of other weapons— than that woman s last resource—his tongue His story was brief, he had dıştın guıshed himself m the wars against John the Third of Castile, and having become enamoured of the daughter ol one of the principal Moorish nobles, her fathei had resolved that he should
127
not wed her, until he had proved him¬ self worthy of so great a jewel by deed« of arms. " Now then,'' said the Prince," heai me, Ravenspur, the Lady Geraldine must take her seat among her equals to-morrow. Let her clothe herself in robes worthy of her rank—let her wear a veil, and we will lead her to the lists, and crave for an unknown stranger the seat of honour. What, think you the ladies of this fair city will refuse a boon from two brave knights ? No, in¬ stantly despatch thy servant, and make known thy pleasure to thy lady love— and bear her," he continued, addressing Jaques, " this chaplet fair to bind this flowing veil—tell her, that to no mortal being, save her alone, would I consign these toys—tell her they belonged to her peer in beauty, love, and truth." Jaques joyfully obeyed this command, and, with pride of heart, he longed for the morrow that he might see his lady о 4
128
clad as she was wont to be Raven spur did not ıetum till late, or rather early in the morning, but his Geraldine was waiting to receive him She had, with the assistance of the nurse, pre pared a dres«, which shehad brought with her from England, and Ravenspui, with delight, on the following morning be held her arrayed in a robe of black vel vet, the front of which was adorned with jewels —it came close to the throat, round which was a band also of gold and silver The long flowing veil which Prince Achmet had sent, was fastened round her head with a chaplet of silver roses, and fell to the ground behind, and though it extended below her waist only in the front where it opened it was edged with gold, and so full and ample, that it neaily con cealed her features on her hands she wore embroidered gloves of silk, and a superb rosary of gold beads was sus pended to her girdle Her boy ivas
129
present when she put on these costly gar ments— and, as she proceeded, scarcely seemed to recognise his mother in the splendidly attired being who coveted his embrace At length he became re conciled, and began to amuse himseli with discomposing the dark auburn locks which fell on the forehead and neck ot Geraldine But the hour of her dt parture drew near, and a covered horse litter being provided, she was accom pamed by her husband to Punce Ach met s dwelling At the door he met the litter but Geraldine did not alight I will not, said he, ' see thy fair face noble lady till I have fulfilled niy duty to my own Zemira Would to Heaven that thou and she wert com paring beauty in the crystal ninrors ol the Alhambra But I must not glante that way Besides t ıs time we should be gone The fair assembly of ladies had al ready taken their seats—the heralds o5
130
were in attendance, and yet the knights combatant were not arrived. Various opi¬ nions were given upon the cause of this delay, and murmurs of impatience were beginning to be expressed, when a bustle appeared at one of the avenues leading to the lists—"They come—they come," was now the cry, but in curious guise. They were clad in aimour, but were without esquires. They were leading each his own charger, and in the other hand they held the broidered rein (which had on the preceding day graced the courser ofthe Moor) ofa horse bearing a litter. Upon arriving at the entrance of the lists, they paused, and the master of the ceremony for the day advanced, and bade a herald ask the meaning of their appearance, and why they led a horse bearing a litter to the area, where they were to fulfil the challenge of the fok lowing day. Another herald advanced to give their answer, which Prince Ach¬ inet dictated in the following terms:
131
We come to fulfil our engagement «is true knights —but crave, previous to thc combat, a boon of those fair dames \ stranger lady, of noble birth and name, craves the lionour of a seat amid yon fiir and beauteous company Stran gers as we are, we hope to prove our selves not unworthy so great an ho nour " The herald having made known the ι ause of their appearance in this extra oidmary manner, the fair damsel who presided as queen of thc sports, bade the lady welcome, and ordering a seat lor thc stianger, she descended one step Irom her temporary throne to meet the Lady Geraldine \s Ravenspur assisted his lady to alight a buz of approbation ran through thc admiring crowd and as she was led by the Moorish Pnnce to the seat pie pared foi her, the gaze of every knight was fixed on her alone She appeared much agitated, foi scarcely could she 06
132
mount thc step, and her obeisance to the surrounding company, though grace ful, was evidently accompanied by much effort The veil concealed her features, but it betrayed the whiteness ol her cheek Scarcely could she support the chill which shot through her heart, as the Alooi, bowing gracefully, left her to take his seat at one end of tho lists There was something so stiange and so mysterious in the whole of this pro ceedmg that the spectators awaited with impatience for an éclaircissement That two rival knights each appearing to maintain the superiority of hb mis tress over thit of any other lady in tht world should thus amicably entci the lists, was so singular and so novel that the greatest impatience marked every countenance At length the usual forms having been gone through, each knight mounted his steed and couching his lance waited for the signal of the fight
133
with anxiety when the word had passed, the combatants rushed furiously to the onset, and displayed such masterly skill, that every knight pressed forward with a feeling of enthusiasm to watch the progress of the best tilting bout they had evei witnessed Shouts from the populace betrayed how deeply they were mteiested in the result Long did the contest last, and eagerly did Geral dine watch eveiy moment, at length the Moor aimed so dexterous a blow at his adversary, that Ravenspur tottered in his seat, yet, ere Achmet could pursue the advantage he had gained, Raven ««pur was again erect Geraldine had half started from her seat, when she saw her husband foiled, but as soon sunk into it again, when he legamcd his position Agam and agam they wheeled round the area, and met full laced—but at length each, weary of the contest, resolved to exert his utmost

>kill and strength for an instant they paused at the opposite extremities ot the area, then each shouting the name ot Geraldine and Zemira, rushed with -,uch impetuosity agamst each othet, that they both leeled in their saddles, and fell The air was now rent with shouts ol triumph, for both had displayed such skill and strength, both h ul behaved so courteously to each other that the master of the field forbade the lenewal of the combat Ravenspui and Achmet then rose —and, upon heanng this fiat, thej joined hands and advanced to the lady who held the pnze, each contend ing that his opponent had won it Joyfully did the Lady Geialdmt descend liom hei scat, and havın,; (hanked the company for the honoui they had done hei she was conducted by Ravenspui and Achmet to her lit ter, and, attended by them, airived at

137
which was sheltered they rested their horses, and took some refreshment So hurried had they been in then move ments, that till this moment it never oc curred to Ravenspur that his lady was still a stranger to Achmet The fiist moment of repose they enjoyed was under the shade of a grove of acacias, and there, when the boisterous little Richard had pulled aside the travelling hood which concealed his mother s face Achmet hrst beheld the wife of his youthful friend, who had contended with him in the field at Burgos There was a witching softness in the countenance of the lady Geraldine, and the kindling blush whicli rose as the Moorish Prince approached her gave an additional charm to a countenance at all times beautiful and interesting — Fair lady, said the gallant Moorish Prince, " had I seen thy face before I entered the lists agamst my noble friend, I had been hopeless indeed Zemira s
138
beauty must yield to thine ; though, as her own true knight, I dare not confess as much to any one but thee. Yet thou shalt see my love, and tell her what I said. Ah, you little rogue," he con¬ tinued, as Richard scrambled up his mother's knee, endeavouring at thc same time to drive away Prince Achmet, " What! may I not look upon thy beau¬ teous mother? Well, well, thou shalt have thy way. See, Ravenspur, already he can protect his mother." " Nor wonder at that," replied Ravenspur, smiling, " for few can boast her equal as a mother.—But, my Geraldine, art thou rested? The evening falls, and some few miles remain ere we reach a shelter for the night. We did wrong, methinks, to quit Toulouse without a guide ; the paths here are numerous and intricate. On before us, Jaques, end reconnoitre a little. Would that we had reached Marseilles." " Pear not, fair lady," said Achmet,
139
through those distant trees I spy my faithful followers, and by my knight hood, two Christians with them ' Ravenspui soon discovered they were his attendants, and thus recruited, they Ielt secure from all attacks Their road now lay through the interior of this wood, for the only path which presented itself was narrow and overgrown, and through the middle of the forest As they continued their journey, they п«Ч a friar, who was also on his way to Marseilles Ravenspur greeted thc father with respect, and inquired of him how far they Avere fıom the place of then destination " My son, ' replied the friar, " thou hast another days journey to perform, and perilous is the task, foi these woods, and the moun tains beyond, are infested by banditti It is not long since they attacked a mo Mastery, which is about two miles from hence, but a party of troops being on their way fiom Spain to France, arrived
но
unexpectedly in the neighbourhood, and put the robbers to flight. Two of them were taken prisoners, and executed.— Truly, my son, I joy to see thee ; for I scarcely hoped to pass the forest in safety." Here the friar looked around him, and eyeing Achmet and his followers with a suspicious eye, he drew Raven¬ spur on one side, as he crossed himself, and exclaimed, " Holy Virgin ! what is it I see ! Moors ! Infidels I Then in¬ deed we are lost. Separate thyself, my son, from such unholy company ; or else expect the vengeance of heaven to fall upon thee." " Father," replied Ravenspur, " that Moor is my particular friend, and were I to desert him, without just cause, the vengeance of heaven would deservedly fall upon me. Thou art at liberty to quit us, but myself and company shall journey on together." Then turning from the friar, he addressed his lady
141
thus " Art thou rested, my Geraldine , the time is precious, and it would be advisable that we should pass the forest ere the sun sets In the open plain wc can defend ourselves, if we perchance should meet some straggling maraude is from the Pyrenees The reverend father yonder seems a hero, for aloue he ven tures to encounter a host of them, as he declares, rather than join company with us, forsooth—because that Achinet and his suite are with us Well, we shall see but tb this spirit which hardens the hearts of infidels to the beauty and real principles of our Holy Religion ' " I am leady, replied Geraldine , " I am rested now, my lord, and our beasts appear refreshed The monk may play the hero—but I hope I sliall have no cause to play the heroine Our travellers instantly renewed their journey, and proceeded without inter ruption through the forest The monk was still in sight, and seemed pur
143
posely to keep within a certain distance ofthe wicked Chnstian who could have fellowship with Infidels He was ob served to slacken his pace as he entered the small plain into which the forest opened, and to look cautiously around htm, then he would proceed a few steps, then halt, and as Jaques \iatched hım, the latter became anxious they should clear the forest, he therefore pushed on the mule' of Geraldine and her female attendant, and they reached the confines of the forest in safety yet scarcely had they emerged from the trees when the monk was observed to make a full stop, and Jaques, catching Raven spur by the arm, and putting hts finger on his lip at the same time, pointed to a large tree on the left, around which were reposing two or three mtn Our travellers' party was too large to hope to pass them unobserved, and they me ehanically halted They were armed it was true, but the danger was, that
14а
they might be surrounded by others whom they did not see Yet there ap peared no alternative, and Ravenspur and Achmet resolved on pursuing then journey They therefore advanced at their former pace, but as the sound of the horses feet stole upon the ears of the robbers, (for such they wcie,) the latter started up, and one of them blew a small hoin In an instant, fiom vd nous parts of the wood, there advanced several men all aimed " Stand, stand, w as the cry, and oui travellers, w ho had by this time maiked an opening glade, did stand, but it и as to place the Lady Ravenspur, thc nurse, and child, m their centre, round whom they ar ranged themselves, and piepared to de fend themselves to the last " A prize—a prize, shouted one of the men, " tell our Captain an oppor tunity occurs for revenging himself on the monks of St Dommick The monk, who had proceeded under the conduct
144
of our travellers, now ran with all speed towards Ravenspur, and entreated his protection Achmet made way for the friar to pass, and enter the circle, close by the Lady Geraldine s litter he took his station, and began to repeat his Ave Maries in very audible accents Raven spur could scarcely suppress a smile at the contemptible and pusillanimous con duct of the friar, and, as is often the case, the cowardice the father dis played recalled to Ravenspur thc steady courage of Father Nicholas There was however, but little time forthought, the robbers advanced front and rear— and one of the chiefest of them ad vancing forwards, bade the travellers yield at once The man who spoke was tall his figure commanding, and his fellows appeared to treat him with great respect ' I am always unwilling, he added to shed blood, and I perceive, by the manner in which you have ananged
143
yourselves, that you have a treasure withm worth the fighting for But as that is a kind of treasure we care little about, and you seem to listen to us courteously, we will let you pass freely and unmo tested, provided you give up the monk, that same brave gentleman who is, I perceive, clinging fast to the crupper of the lady's mule ' " We are knights,' replied Ravenspur, " and by the laws of knighthood, not to mention the laws of humanity, we are bound to defend the helpless , and should therefore be disgraced for ever, and unworthy of bearing arms, if we could assent to so cowardly a proposal ' " You must take the conséquences then," replied the robber but ere he pronounced these few words, a spear whizzed through the air, and glanced by Ravenspur, against whom it ivas raised Indignant at this proceeding, the captain turned hastily round and inquired, " Who had dared to interrupt vol. ш H
ш
his parley by this unwarrantable breach of the laws of war' A dark looking man advanced and owned himself the aggressor, and lamented that his blow had failed " Although a robber, he exclaimed, "lama christian, and keep no faith with heretics See you not there aie moors with them' Achmet raised his lance, but Raven¬ spui prevented him from using it,—yet the blood of the moor boiled with m dignation at hearing himself thus stig inatized by a robber, and in the heat of the moment he exclaimed, " Ravenspur foi beai " The villam who had aimed at Raven spur now advanced towaids the captain, and whispered in his ear, " that the securing of that knight would make his foitune " There is a pnct set upon his head —" I was in search of him nhen I met youi brave fellows, and was promised a thousand crowns of gold if I could but secure Ins person '
147
" Indeed ' exclaimed the robber " Ah, a thousand crowns ! but for what crime is he proscribed ' " Why,' replied the man, rt he had the misfortune to be guilty of the crime of being an eldest son andthe younger one, being a lad of spirit, asserted nature s laws, and claimed his own Do you understand me, captain ' He whis pered strange things, and the formei scorning to have recourse to art, wheie candour failed, was attainted, his lands and title confiscated, and himself and his wife banished But his brother not being quite sure but that the wheel may go round agam, ıs anxious to make all sure There are two fellows now sent to Spain in search of lnm, and I have heard, that except for his lady's sake, he would return to England and tace his loes ' While the captain and this fellow were thus in confeience, Raven spur and Achmet had been consulting with Jaques upon then future conduct h 2 V
149
The latter advised that they should throw themselves upon the generosity of the chief, " Believe me, my lord, he continued, " I know them well, there is honour emong thieves, and the only drawback to my plan is, that this poor monk may still be a bar to oui safety ' The captain at this moment advanced towards them, and the fellow, who had mst betrayed the name of Ravenspur, attended him " Sir knight, ' said the chief, " I have just learned from my comrade your quality and degree ,—that you are a pro scribed man, and that a price is set upon your head These circumstances are claims upon our protection for yourself individually, and for your suite by our courtesy The moor and the monk foim no part of your retinue, you are free to pass, they must remain our prisoners " For myself I thank you, ' replied
149
Ravenspur, " but the moor ıs one of my earliest, dearest friends, and the monk has thrown himself upon my protection How then can I resign their society without forfeiting the title by which you addressed me? One and all we pass, or one and all we try our strength But as ye are men, and I trust have still some remaining feelings of our common nature, permit us to place the women and the child in safety while we try ' " Not for worlds, ' exclaimed Geral dine, " will we be separated from thee, mylord There is no place of safety for thy wife and son, except beneath the shelter of thine own brave arm If indeed," she continued, advancing to the front, " these robbers must have blood, we will die together here is my post, nor shall I move, though you," she continued, again addressing the robbers, are six times our number,—I will not shrink " With Ravenspur on one side, and я 3
150
Achmet on the other, Geraldine fancied herself unattainable to danger, and her sparkling eye and animated countenance formed a striking contrast to the pale and timid visage of the monk who stood close behind her " Now, by St Anthony, lady, replied the robber, " thou art worthy thy noble rank,— thou art worthy thy noble spouse I dare not attack you, ' he added, speak mg to Ravenspur and Achmet, " for with such a stimulus to bravery a host could not successfully oppose you Now, lady, permit the honoui of touch¬ ing that fair hand, and for thy sake m future no female of any description shall ever become our prisoners As for yon holy friar, he is beneath our notice, we must find more worthy means of revenging ouiselves on the monks of St Domimck,—he too is free to go, but he must pass on alone,—take the word, good father, and depart, 'tis ' Roebuck ' As for this goodly com

There are many of my men abroad in different parts, I cannot answer for them ;—but wait till morning, then they shall be free to go, ourself will bear thee company." " We accept thy courtesy," said Ravenspur, " but though we fear not open war, yet we are doubtful of our safety, since the man who betrayed my name and rank to thee, must have rea¬ sons for knowing both, which puts our lives in peril." " He shall not molest you," said the chief;—" Antonio, to the cave, there are travellers expected on that road, and rich ones too ;—take ten of our comrades with thee. What, dost thou grumble ? Away, I say." Antonio muttered something which our travellers could not understand, but the captain drawing his dagger, held it to the villain's heart, " Swear," he cried, " by the holy rood, never, by direct or h 4

indirect means, to injure any one ofthe present company. Is it not enough a man should be banished, deprived of home and country, of wealth and rank, of all, save honour 1 But thou must seek his life. Away, away, Antonio, to thy post. Let me see nought of thee till thou returnest rich with the spoils of the reverend Abbot, who journeys by the cave." Antonio surlily withdrew, and the chief then advancing towards Geraldine, courteously entreated " she would ho¬ nour their rude dwelling with her pre¬ sence." Geraldine as courteously ac¬ cepted his offer, and the group of per¬ sons thus assembled, the romantic wild¬ ness of the surrounding country, com¬ bined to form a scene worthy the pencil of Salvator Rosa. Ravenspur clad in a plain suit of armour, led his lady's mule ; beside her rode Achmet in the Moorish costume. Six of his attendants followed. Jaques, Robert and Thomas, walked
1S3
beside their lord While the nuise with the child went on in front In various parts were group» of banditti, whose wild attire antl fierce countenance accorded well with their mode of life, while the rude rocks which surrounded them on all sides, except where the forest formed a sombre back ground, piesented alternate projections and hoi lows, the extremities of which being wrapped in shade misled the eye, and the imagination instantly transformed them into interminable caverns After walking about a quarter of an hour, they halted before a majestic rock, and here the captain ordered scats Two or three stools were then produced, one of which was occupied by Geraldine, another by the nurse Ravenspur and Achmet seated themselves on the ground, and Rinaldini placed himself by them Ravenspur was uot at all satisfied with his situation ,—the number of men who appeared and disappeared frequently, h 5
154
the significant glances he fancied they exchanged, made lnm uneasy as the night advanced At length a hom sounded, which was answered by Rinaldini, who made the rocks ring again Ravenspur looked at Achmet anxiously, then at his lady and his boy, who was playing at his feet The robber chief saw his anxiety, and using from the ground, he entered the cave, but he soon re appeared, leading in his hand a üne boy about eight years old " Sir Knight,' said the robbei, " you doubt my faith,—but I pardon you, Rinaldini never yet bioke hts »oid to friend or foe , behold this boy, he is the pledge of my sincerity, take him, keep him in the midst of you, and if I prove false, plunge a dagger in his heait * Geraldine shuddered as he pushed the boy into the circle, and Rinaldini quietly retook his former posi tton But now, on the opposite rocks, was seen a number of persons descend
135
ing from their summits; and as they wound round the different defiles, Ra¬ venspur expressed his astonishment to their chief, how he could keep such a number of lawless beings in subjection? " The bond of interest ties them to me, yet there are moments when it re¬ quires all my self-possession to maintain my authority ; but you must excuse me for a time ; some of our people aie re¬ turned from an expedition to thc Py¬ renees. Upon all these occasions my presence is necessary to divide the spoils. Anon, I will be with you ; you have my pledge," he added, pointing to his child, " poor luckless wight, thou hast been my guardian angel, be thou still my pride, my joy." Here the robber turned suddenly away, and Geraldine observed there was somethmg very singular in this man's deportment. " But see," she added, " see, my Ravenspur, and will there be no end to that line of men V pointing h6
156
as she spoke to a rock, from thc base of ivhich they seemed to issue. " See how they gaze on us; alas! for what are we reserved? Rinaldini now ap¬ proaches them, and points to yon but¬ ting cliff; now they wheel round it, and the last two stand still, and again fix their eyes on us. Would to heaven we were away from this desolate place." " Fear not, dear lady," said Achmet, " we will defend thee and thy boy from evil." Geraldine sighed and watched Rinal¬ dini, who, resting one hand upon his sword which touched the ground, pointed ivith the other to the cliff already men¬ tioned, as two of the hindmost men lingered behind. " What can tempt you," said Geral¬ dine, addressing the thoughtful chief as he approached ; " what can tempt you to lead this life of care in this rude solitude?" Rinaldini smiled, but his smile was soon replaced by a sterner
157
feeling,—his brows were knit, his eyes sparkled, and his whole frame ac trnired an additional degree of fiimness, as he said,—" Tbat lady, which makes kings robbers, the hve r¡f power Here I command, and heie I am obeyed,— elsewhere it were my lot to yield obe diencc to some ignoble minded mor tal whom the fates have named a prince Heie I am sovereign, absolute, none here dare dispute my word, or if they do, I know the way to humble them My followers know no law but this — my will I fear me, lady, I shall have occasion to prove this to thee e'er the sun shall rise again But of this be sure, thyself and friends are as safe beneath the shelter of this rude rock, as though the pompous roof of a cathedral threw its protecting shade upon thy lovely head, no woman ei/er yet needed Rinaldini s assistance, and was refused But thou, lady, need st it not,—thou hast a brave husband, faithful servants, and a
158 zealous friend, to shield thee ; yet Ri¬ naldini's voice may do more than they." Rinaldini again left them, and our anxious travellers followed him with their eyes, till he turned round a pro¬ jecting rock and disappeared from their view.

CHAP. VIII.
1 ----------- the wild fastnesses are ours, The rocks, with their eternal towers ' The soul to struggle and to dare. Mrs. Hemans Soon after the departure of Rinaldini, some of his followers appeared with provisions, of which our travellers thankfully partook. But when Jaques was to have had his share he was miss¬ ing, nor was he visible for more than an hour; when he did join them, his brow was thoughtful, and an unusual cast of thought threw a gloom over his whole countenance. He beckoned Ach¬ met, and disclosed to him, that from Rinaldini's manner he suspected that
160
they should not yet get off without a brush. " I therefore," he continued, " attached myself to one of thc robbers who seemed idly gazing at our party, and expressed to him our gratitude for the chief's protection. " Ah," he re¬ plied, " if he can grant you protection it's mighty well, but he begins to lose his influence ;—he is too merciful to please the major part of the community, and if you were not so well armed and such resolute fellows, it would go hard with you. There was a teirible mur¬ muring when Rinaldini gave you quar¬ ter, but the fellows who hai e just re¬ turned loaded with spoil, are some of the most desperate fellows in our gang ; however, the captain v is"a brave fellow, and has many sincere friends among us ;—and for that lady's sake you will have many friends. The women we generally fall in with are such muling, puling creatures, that they seem born for no other purpose except to encum-
161
ber their friends ;—but I must begone, it won't do for us to be seen together. Return to your friends, and be upon your guard;—the captain is true, but all his fellows are not of his opinion. You had best remain where you are, don't go into the cave." " Here he left me,'' continued Jaques, " not a lit¬ tle dismaycdat the prospect before me." " Say nought of this to any one else," replied Achmet, " I will give Ravenspur a hint as to not entering the cave, and the rest we must leave to chance." Achmet and Jaques then joined their friends, and the former liaving made this communication to Ravenspur, they waited patiently the result. At sun-set Rinaldini again joined them, and pro¬ posed that they should enter the cave. Ravenspur, however, thanked him for his offer, but said they should prefer passing thc night in the open air, as the weather was mild, and but little dew."
162 " As you please," was the reply, and Rinaldini calling to some of his people, ordered cloaks to be brought, and having, drawn a circle round them, he forbade any one of his followers to cross it " on pain of his displeasure." He then placed two sentinels, and bade them, as they knew their duty, to per¬ form it." He then kissed his boy, who struggled to follow him,—and bidding his guests good night, withdrew into the cave. A silence of some minutes foUowed his departure, and then Ravenspur pro¬ posed that they should prepare a resting place for the nurse and children ; some fine long grass cut with their sabres ivas first spread, over which the cloaks were thrown, and on this homely bed they stretched their weary limbs. Soothed by the kindness of Geraldine, young Rinaldini's grief subsided by de¬ grees, and at last his troubles were for¬ gotten in the arms of sleep.
163
For a long time Geraldine resisted the drowsiness which at length overcame her. The Moor too had yielded to the influence of the drowsy god ;—and Thomas and Robert forgot all their cares, and by their deep breathing con¬ vinced their lord they too had become insensible to the dangers of their pre¬ sent situation. Ravenspur, Achmet, and Jaques, were, however, wide awake ; anxiety prevented their inclination to sleep ;—yet they were fearful of com¬ municating their thoughts to each other, lest the sentinels who were placed as their guard should prove traitors. The first watch of the night passed quietly, and at midnight the sentinels were re¬ lieved. In one of these, Jaques recog¬ nised the man that had given him the warning. - This fellow seemed to be very vigilant, and one of the robbers appearing, he called out, " who goes there?" " Martin, do you not know your
104
comiede , by my soul, and you seem to have got a cold birth there How long have you stood sentry over these strange outlandish gentry '—I 11 relieve you" " No, no, ' replied Martin, " thank you, comrade, I can do my duty, I have received my orders " " Indeed t ' replied the fellow, who fancied our travellers were all asleep " And what were they ' " To collar the first man who inter rupted my watch,—and if he were fac tious to run him through " " Ha' ha! ha!" was the answei of the villain, " a valiant, a right valiant knight Why, Martin, I thought you had some sense in your body , but I find you lack it confoundedly ^Who ever collared me and escaped with life' ' " I neither know nor care, replied Martin coolly , " but this I know, unless you take yourself off in a twinkling, I shall make the experiment "
165
Two other men at this moment were seen emerging from behind a jutting rock, and from various parts others were advancing, when thc second sentinel, who was on the opposite side of the little entrenchment, if it may be so called, cried out, " Hola ! Martin, who goes there ľ' " One Pierre," replied Martin, " a hungry fellow, whose stomach is capable of digesting cold steal, as he imagines." " Begone," said the second sentinel, " interrupt not our watch." " The voices were now too loud for those of our travellers, who were awake, to feign asleep any longer ;—and those who were really insensible were roused from their recumbent posture. " How," resumed the man who last spoke, " are you mad ?—know you not the captain's orders ?" " We heed them not," was the re¬ ply—" Villain!" exclaimed the second sentinel, advancing towards the fellow,
166
and resuming the authoritative tones of Rinaldini ; " You heed them not ! back, I say, back ; or, by St Paul, I '11 strike you dead." Ravenspur and Achmet, and all their suite were completely aroused, and had formed themselves ina close little body round Geraldine, and the defenceless part of their company. By this time there were assembled at least twenty of the robbers ; yet Rinal¬ dini dauntlessly advanced towards them. " Cowards, as you are—what, would you steal upon your sleeping prey like common thieves? Come on, I fear you not ; it becomes brave men like you to attack the defenceless:—Ah, your swords are bright, your arms are strong ; why do you hesitate ? I see the reason, nore hands were necessary— well, come on, all, every man of you ; Rinaldini shall not desert himself, neither does ho want brave friends to back him. Traitors, villains! by my soul ye are not fit to live."
167
Thi robbers exhibited every symp torn of rage during this speech, yet they did not attempt to strike their captain, their plan appeared to be perfectly ma tured, for they gathered round him as if to encircle him But Ravenspur was no longer able to be a calm spectator of this unequal contest He advanced, therefore, to the assistance of the brave Rinaldini " Back, back—Sir Knight, said Rinaldini, " Stir not on your life back, back, I say—or you break the con tract between us Fear not for me Vou know not tho mettle of those brave fellows who, in a body, attack my life back, I say, Sir Knight ' There ivas something so imperative so commanding m Rinaldini's manners, that Ravenspur himself retreated, wait¬ ing the result of this adventure with breathless anxiety Rinaldini having placed himself so that the robbers formed a semi circular array before him, he called out—" Lay down your arms
168
'Tis Rinaldini commands ; death awaits him who disobeys. What ! do ye hesi¬ tate? Down, I say," he continued, strik¬ ing a sword from one of the villains' hands; twenty swords were instantly pointed towards his heart. Rinaldini still remained unmoved, and the fellows withheld the blow. " Down, 1 say"— and slowly the points of the swords reached the ground. Rinaldini then paced before them for some time with haughty steps, saying at the same time; " Cowardly dastards, villains, to steal in this time of the night like the fierce hyena upon the dead; are not the sleeping and the dead the same ? Why not like the lion, when in search of food, boldly have attacked them, even in open day. Shame on you ! shame on you all ! You are not fit to keep com¬ pany with brave men ; away, away, every one to his post : dost hear ? must I have recourse to arms ? must I ring that knell upon your ears will reach Tou-
169
louse ' ' Several of the robbers sneaked away, yet a few seemed bent on shed ding blood, and kept their ground Ri naklini waited some minutes to see whether they would obeytnm, but find ing they still lingered, he said, " Since it must be so—why so it must be " He instantly drew a silverhorn from be¬ neath his cloak, and at the well known sound a troop of robbers assembled, all armed, and rushed towards their chief, yet, ere they approached him, the fore most of the rebels, who was indeed An¬ tonio, who had betrayed the name of Ravenspur, had aimed a blow at Rinal¬ dini, and the two were engaged in close combat " Secure the rebels," was his cry, as his faithful men advanced, and a fierce contest now ensued Ri naldım contended long and nobly with his adversary, who fought with a des¬ perate resolution, at length, however, the chief levelled his opponent to the ground, but as thc villain fell he made a
170
thrust at Rinaldini, and the latter stagger¬ ed backwards. Ravenspur and Achmet had been in astate of absolute torture at being thus compelled to remain specta¬ tors only of this scene, and they me¬ chanically rushed forward and sup¬ ported the falling captain ; his wound was not mortal, but his blood flowed copiously, and Geraldine, who was skil¬ ful in suigery, advanced to the relief of their brave and gallant defender. "Ah !" he said, looking at her ; " who would not endure a thousand times as much as this;" as his frame, yielding to thc pangs of suffering nature, shrunk mechani¬ cally even from her tender touch. " Who would not endure a thousand times as much as this, for such a reward as this ? " Ravenspur looked anxiously around him at this moment, to see the fortune of the night. " Fear nothing," said the wounded man, " my followers know their duty. How now, Martin, how goes the fight?"
171
" Sharp, replied Martın , I see many fall " It must not bc, said the captain, " give the word, Roebuck Martin advanced to the combatants and calling out, " Roebuck, ' the rob hers dropped their swords, and tht rebels looked around The captain's wounded, and Antonio is dead con tmued Martın Do you give the woid back " Roebuck, they replied, in an under voice, and slowly they dispersed, yet not before they had inquired, it the captain a hurt were dangerous t " Ask the lady that, for she is dress mg his wound, replied Martin she whom you would have murdered ' We did not intend it,' said ont of them, ' we only wanted to securt the knight, upon whost head a price is set " And do you think she would havt survived such perfidy ' replied Martin, Heard you not her brave speech, saw ι a
172
you not her noble courage' By St Jaques, but she deserves to be ensamt ed when she dies Ah, she is a brave woman, and our captain did but do justice to stay our hands well, to bc sure, it is no matter, the affair is ended, and will be a future warning Ah ' this is a piteous sight bear those bodies to the cemetery, let not the captain see them Geraldine in the mean while having dressed the captains wound, he m sisted upon being allowed to remain with them, and some of his people having brought skins and cloaks, a couch was made for him His pool boy, who had often witnessed affrays of this kind, had gazed unmoved upon the scene of confusion, until his father fell—he then rushed towards him and wept bitterly Now he lay upon the same couch, and by his childish and alternate expres sions of joy and sorrow, soothed and wounded the heart of his father who
173
caressed him in the most affectionate manner. The boy, at length, weary and exhausted, fell fast asleep, and Rinal¬ dini, who imagined that all who sur¬ rounded him were either so'engaged or too deeply wrapped in thought to heed him, gave vent to his paternal feelings in tears. Geraldine observed this, and pressing her own boy to her bosom, she poured forth her thanks to heaven for their own immediate preservation, and that her child was not generally exposed to the dangers which constantly surrounded the young Rinaldini. Ravenspur and Achmet were upon the alert, and as the bright morning star ap¬ peared, " Hesperus," that led the morn, and the rosy streaks of the bright god of day overpowered the paler light of the moon ; the former wrapped himself in his cloak, while Achmet with his moors kept watch. Two hours they slept; when the captain, rousing from i3
174
uneasy slumbers, disturbed them. Ra¬ venspur started from his sleep, and per¬ suaded his friend and his followers to take some refreshment, and then repose a while. He took his station by Geral¬ dine —and they sat for some time in silence, enjoying the sweetness of the morning breeze, and watching with de¬ light the dispersing of the light vapours which hung on the mountain's-tops, and which presented a beautiful line of varied radiance like that of the rainbow, fonned by the refraction of the sun's rays upon the morning dew. The forest behind them was still wrapped in a magnificent gloom, for the sun's slant¬ ing rays could not penetrate its thick foliage, though it fronted the east. How refreshing is the first dawn of day to the weary traveller, who bewildered through the live-long night by wander¬ ing through unknown paths, finds him¬ self at once cheered by light; and the prospect of being soon released from all
175
their anxiety by the facility which the bright god of day afforded them of pro¬ secuting their journey. After such a night as our travellers had undergone, it was ecstasy to con¬ template every surrounding object, and to a certainty ascertain its proximity to them, and its nature. Danger seem¬ ed to have fled with the shades of night : for although the moon had illumined them during the affray, yet from the broad masses of shade upon the rocks them¬ selves, and produced by them upon the ground, their vision was imperfect, and the silvery light itself oft threw a deceit¬ ful glare upon the objects which they most wished to ascertain. A litter being made for Binaldini, he was borne by his followers to a con¬ siderable distance from the spot oc¬ cupied by our travellers ; there he gave orders as to the proceedings of the day, then again took up his quarters by the 1 4
176
side of the lady Geraldine ; to whom he addressed himself thus : " Such scenes as those of yester¬ night, but ill accord with your sex and breeding, lady. But I have one request to make, since I hold it politic you and your noble friends should early quit this rude and^ uucourtly solitude. Couldst thou intrust to me the secret of the healing balm thou hast applied to my burning, throbbing wound, I would give thee gold to any price." " Most willingly," replied the dame ; " yet I grieve, noble Rinaldini, to quit thee till thy wound were better—it needs a tender hand ; and here, me¬ thinks, there is no female that could supply my place." " You are right," resumed the robber chief, and his flushed cheek became pale as death. " She who could, who would, have poured in the balm of consolation—who would, with equal tenderness, have cooled my burning
177
side, she sleeps under yon cypress tiee For I would not let her bones rest in our cemetery near the unhallowed remains of our faternity —No, Isabelle, thy pure manes were consigned to the grave by my own hands —theie was none save me—and I, how unfit was I, to touch thy sacred form' Yet thou didst think otherwise, iny Isabelle, and ш this solitude, saidst thou wast happy when Rinaldini smiled Listen, lady,— In an affray on the Spanish frontiers, we overtook the lovely Isabella, journeying to France with two good monks, who were conveying hei to this land of gaiety, not to share its pleasures, but to be consigned to a convent's gloom The monks were well attended, for they car ned a rich dower with the lovely dame whicli we more properly applied, sent bäck the monks from whence they came, and bore the lovely Isabelle away Long time she did resist my prayer of love , but she at length consented to be my i5
178
bride, and a priest from Toulouse united us Here we lived happily for four уеагз , but then she died, leaving mc this hoy as a legacy He is the image of his sainted mother,—for saint she \v as , her voice was melody, and when she pleaded foi the unfortunate, she never asked in vain Her life was one continued succession of deeds of mercy She lived but to do good, and appeared among us like an angel of light The sick she attended, and consoled the dying When the minister» of our holy religion refused to approach our rude haunts, she administered consolation to the trembling soul, and hearts of stone shed tears of pity and remorse Oh, had she lived, hundreds would have had cause to bless the day she слте among us Foi never to quit us was her vow, ' No, Rinaldini, she would «ay, 'in this solitude with thee I am happy, and although thou art a robbei, yet by continuing chief of these lawles» men
1Т9
thou mayst do good to thousands. So¬ ciety rejects us, let us then make our happiness independent of society, and let that happiness spring from the good we can do to our fellow-creatures." " Ah, lady, till you appeared among ue, nought so unearthly has consecrated this rude retreat. But you must stay no longer. I have given orders for an es¬ cort to attend you even to Marseilles. The road between this and that place is little frequented, and it may be dan¬ gerous for your party, which looks in¬ viting from the gallant air of your de¬ fenders, and may be attacked by my friends." Ravenspur was anxious to profit by the escort offered, and having arranged every thing, they prepared to take their leave of the brave Rinaldini, whose wound prevented him from accompany¬ ing our travellers on their journey. Ere they separated, Ravenspur had some con¬ versation with the chief, in which he 16
180 intrusted to him the particulars of his fate, and of his present intention of seeking refuge.in Grenada.^ " There, at the court of the Moorish prince, you will find me, Rinaldini ;'' he added, " and remember, if aught should occur, to induce you to quit this mode of life, there I am to be found. You shall find me grateful, and if 1 were now returning to my native land, I would request a sacrifice, whicli, perhaps, though great, your good sense might have induced you to accept, that boy." " Ah! say you so?" exclaimed Ri¬ naldini, " wherever you are, he must be with virtue. Take him, in exile, in poverty with you. Near that angel ofa woman, he will become what Isabelle would have made hiin. Oh take him.'' The boy clung to his father. " I will not go though," said the child, waving his hand against Ravenspur, his little face crimsoned with rage, " I will not go with you ; but will stay here, and be
181
a brave man, and fight like my father, and for my father ' Rinaldini pressed the boy to his bo som " It is m vain, Sir knight, I cannot part with him Yet swear to me, that if he claims thy protection he shall find it ' " I swear it by the holy rood, re plied Ravenspur, energetically Thc child still held fast hold of his father, and his countenance, which had swelled with passion, gradually recovered its beauty, as his fathei assured him he should on no account leave lnm " Go, go,' said the boy to Raven¬ spur, " go, go, away ' ' But, said Geraldine, "you will wish us a good journey ' " Yes, replied the boy, letting go his father ь neck, and scrambling down to seat himself by his father, yes, I hope you will not meet Isıdoıe, tor he is gone to Marseilles , and he is very cruel, father, ' he continued "If I go
182
with them a little way, if we should meet him, he will mind me But you will not take me quite away' ' " No, no, ' replied Ravenspur smiling, " stay where you are, and take care of your father " The boy laughed and said, " so 1 will then, but I hope you will not meet Isidore Do you think they will father ' Wait till he comes home " The boy s anxiety respecting this Isi¬ dore, gave no very favourable impression of this robber's character, and Geraldine most devoutly wished they had reached Marseilles At length they took leave of Rinal¬ dini, and a tear dimmed the eye of the robber as he pressed Ravenspur s hand, saying — " I have done wrong to keep the boy, but he is all I have left to love in this wide world adieu " Then calling Mar tin towards lum, he bade htm remember
183
and bc faithful, and despatch," he added, " the sun is far gone on his day s jouiney ' After again repeating farewell, oui travellers once more began their journey, and following then guides, they soon began to ascend that rock from whence they had seen a party of the banditti descend The young Rinaldini followed them to the foot of the rock, and when they arrived there, he again expressed his hope that they would not meet Isı dore, and waving his bonnet towards them as they mounted, he ran back to his father delighted that the departure ot their guests left lnm again m full liberty to do as he pleased

It was mid-day when our travelleis gained the summit of the rock ; and now they descended gradually, winding among rocky defiles, and pursuing paths which, except to those practised in threading them, would have appeared impassable, and an egress ftom them hopeless. Once, when they had ad-
185
vaneed to a considerable distance, Mar¬ tin bade them look back and take a last view of the robbers'haunt. Ravenspur obeyed, and was surprised to find that, although they had apparently traversed a considerable space, they were still so near the spot where the late events had taken place. He even imagined he could discern the figures of Rinaldini and his little son. Having gazed for some minutes at the romantic view before them, they again resumed their journey through the passes of the mountains which surrounded them ; and entering a deep glen, which was almost impervious to the noon-tide ray, they halted, and refreshed themselves and their mules. Ravenspur and his suite seated them¬ selves under a projecting point, while the robbers at a distance took different stations, as their fancy and inclination led them:—these to the precipitous rocky edge, these to the level ground ) where, stretched at their length, they
186
lay ruminating, or with a listless eye, gazed on the wild grandeur of the ad¬ jacent scenery. Their forms were ge¬ nerally fine, and would have presented fit subjects of study forthe chisel of the statuary, and the pencil of the painter. Exercise had strung every nerve to its proper tone, and given an elasticity to their limbs, which necessarily produced the finest outlines. Upon emerging from this defile, they again ascended by a winding path, and after much toil and difficulty, gained the summit of a rock which commanded a distant view of the sea. Geraldine's heart bounded 'with joy at this sight. The scenery around them began to soften, and to exhibit traces of habita¬ tion. Perpignan, like a precious stone set in gold, appeared in the midst of oliveyards and vineyards, and our tra¬ vellers were impatient to reach the town before night closed in upon them. Yet their guards would not permit them to
187
advance, till they had sent out scouts to see if the formidable Isidore was in the vicinity. Two of these men returned, saying he was advancing, and Martin immediately led Ravenspur and his suite round the rock, and pointing to a cave, told them to remain quietly there. " We are enow to compel him to let you pass," said Martin, " but where we can avoid bloodshed, we have our captain's orders, seconded by our own inclination, to do so. When they have passed the watch tower which overhangs yon beetling clifF, I will be with you ; till then you must be content to submit to that which I know is galling to brave spirits :—but there are times when the bravest must find safety in concealment." Having said this, Martin now left them, and some little time afterwards they heard him talking. " What Martin," said a strange voice, " how came you here ? were you sent
188
in search of us?—or to see we did our duty?" " Neither the one nor the other,\repli. cd Martin, " a little excursionfor our own pleasure, and we hope also for a little profit.—But have you succeeded in your enterprise ?" " When did I fail ?" was the reply. " The treasure is safely stowed—you know where: under the old abbey- wall. I suppose Rinaldini will turn it to cash. What, I suppose, when you were last here, you saw a pair of black eyes that pleased you.—Martin, you are a fool,—are you alone ?" " You see I am,—but Rinaldini expects you impa¬ tiently : adieu, comrade ! I have no time to stay, her black eyes may frown, you know, if I don't keep to my time." Isidore smiled sarcastically, and beckon¬ ing his followers on, they wound round the declivity, and passed rapidly on, chanting the following song ι
189
Merrily, merrily, merrily live we, Under the rock and the green-wood tree; Merrily, merrily, merrily live we, While we pass our days m mirth and glee Chernly, chernly, cherrily live we, While we chase our foes, and make them nee, Chernly, chernly, chernly live we, We scorn their prayer—heed not their pica Pleasantly, pleasantly, pleasantly live we, While we drive them over rock and lea; Pleasantly, pleasantly, pleasantly live we, Let them who doubt it, conic and see Rude as were their voices, yet they kept time and tunc, and thc harmony they produced was in accordance with the scenery which surrounded them, and the country they traversed ; the tra¬ vellers, theiefore, in the cave listened with a degree of pleasure as the sounds died away upon the distant air. When they had completely disap¬ peared, Martin bent his steps to the cave, and marshalling the way the tra¬ vellers again set forward on their jour-
190
ney Descending with quick steps the declivity, they joyfully entered the plain, but before they proceeded fur¬ ther, Martin dismissed some of his men , those who were to approach Perpignan, took out of their wallets or knapsacks the dress of the peasantry, and putting it on, assumed the slouch gait and used the patois ofthe Languedoc countrymen The moon was now risen, and assisted them with her pale beams in their way through the lanes and vineyaids, while it tipped with silver the mountain tops and projections, whose deep shadows gave increasing grandeur to their rude fronts When they had approached the town within a certain distance, Martin halted, saying, " here wc must part He refused, as did his men, accepting any reward fbr their safe conduct After many expressions of mutual re gard, Martın and his followers took their leave, advising their friends at thc

193
anxiety They were roused from their train of thought by the approach of Rt chard Ravenspur, who had escaped from nis mother s grasp, and ran towards them, shouting joyfully Ravenspur rose from his recumbent posture, and seizing his boy, invoked blessings on his head, while Geraldine stood by, gazing with rapture on the two beings whom her heart most on earth loved Yet now that she felt in safety, her thoughts wandeied to England, and her lovely girl, not for worlds, however, would she expose her to the dangers they had lately under gone when they weie settled she would hear of hei,—and till then, she resolved on rewarding Ravenspur for all hta troubles and anxieties, by a cheerful countenance Safely they performed their voyage and reached Alicant, at that delightful season of the year, when the mulberry trees weie in full bearing, and the vines bent under the weight of their purple
194
fruit. All here was bustle and activity ; the magnificent streets were crowded with people; Industry here held her court, and Plenty, her usual attendant, was seen on every side. Ravenspur needed thc sanction of Achmet, for although the rank of the latter was not known exactly, yet that he was a Moor of some consequence his countrymen easily discovered, and they therefore allowed the Christians to pass without molesting them; though they could not forbear uttering the word, " Infidels." Geraldine was so en¬ veloped by her cloak that her counte¬ nance was completely hidden ; but her graceful mein was noticed by those who look upon beauty as one of the virtues ofa woman. Ravenspur's dignified mien drew from them some expressions of admiration; and the lovely boy re¬ ceived his due meed of praise. Achmet led them to a merchant's house, whom he knew, and confided them to his safe-

ty during his absence, since he was compelled to leave them for a time Anxiety to behold Zemira was the pnncipal cause of his departure, but Achmet had also another inducement to quit them It was necessary he should inform his father of the arrival of Ra venspur, and solicit his permission that the English knight might find shelter in Grenada from the malice of his foe« Speedily the young prince arrived at Mahomet s court, and there having briefly given an «iccount of his wander ings, he craved thc boon he had sq much at heart " The unfortunate,' replied Maho met, " are welcome to our kingdom, be they poor or be thcy rich, but the friend of thy early youth, the gallant Ravenspur,—he shall be welcome to an asylum where'er he list —But, Achmet, is Ravenspur thy first care'" " No, my Sire, rephed Achmet, " my duty and my love to thee impelled my
196
steps to visit Grenada, his safety was my next chief care, and now for myself I crave permission to visit the lovely Zcmira ' " Go, my son,' said Mahomet, " and may Heaven prosper thy suit ' Zemiw has since thine absence secluded hersell from all society, and her sue has ear nestly expected thy return Haste then, my son, and by thy marriage bind to our throne and personal interests thc fuend ship of one ot the most powerful of our nobles I will despatch a trusty escort to Abcant, that shall in safety and with lionour convey thy fuend» to Grenada Thou wilt give proper directions where they are to be found, and leave the rest to me " Achmet joyfully obeyed his fathei s commands, and repaired to the palace of Alt-Taleb, the father of his Zenura Thc nobleman leceived lum with open arm», and welcomed lum to Grenada, with all the warmth of a father " Ze

mira sighs for thy return," said Ali, " I will hasten to inform her of thy arrival By Mahomet !" he added, " but it glads my soul to grasp thine hand, and see thee thus in beauty's manly pride, with glory coveied, and ivith faith un¬ changed. Now shall I die happy, since Zemira in thee will find a friend, kind and powerful. These are stormy times ; the Moorish power in Spain wanes, my good Achmet; and the power of our holy Prophet totters to its base.—But no mou* of this,—I see impatience in thine eye —I will instantly to Zemira." Ali-TaUb was absent but a short time, and t ıe delighted Achmet follow¬ ed him tl-rough marble halls, with bur¬ nished fretted roofs, till they entered the gardens of the palace. There Ali left him, and pointing to an arbour which terminated the alley of orange- trees before them, bade him proceed and prosper. Bounding with a heart light as air s3
198
through the perfumed path, he in a few minutes attained the arbour There he found the trtmbling Zemira, anxiously expecting his approach Her fine dark eyes in liquid lustre, half closed at 1пч approach, and hti gentle spirit over come by the enhancing hope, that Ach met was there never to forsake her, overcame and sunk her to the earth Eagerly he rushed forward, raised her, and led her to a mossy bank, close by a marble fount Speechless they gazed upon each other,—soft sighs alone be trayed the happiness too great for ut terance At length Achmet bioke the spell —" Zemira ι he exclaimed, " my own Zemira ' to see thee thus,—to see thee, and feel that I am welcome, that absence has but entwined me closer to thine heart, is bliss would repay whole years of suffering Zemira s transpaient veti did but ill conceal the

" Achmet," she replied, as her beau¬ teous face turned from his ardent gaze, " that thou shouldst be restored to me safe and true, has been ray ardent prayer since last we parted ; for thee I have wept; and when the closing hour of day called others to repose, I waked to think of thee. But thou art silent, Achmet, hast thou nought to tell qf thy tedious wanderings? 'Tis now full twelve months since last we parted, and thou hast traversed distant climes, and tried thy skill in arms. Tell me, dear Achmet, tell me all, that when I leave thee, I may think this Achmet did,—this Achmet said and thought, when I was
200
quiet here, and safe from harm and peril, except the fear of losing him." " Indeed, Zemira," returned Ach¬ met, " the tale were long to tell ; yet this mark, where'er I went, where'er I came, thou wert my theme ; and ladies, whose beauty had been proclaimed both far and wide, ivere compelled to yield the palm to thee. Once, and once only, I bore not off the prize ; but then I lost it not;—nor, pardon'me, dear Zemira, nor did I wish to win it. Thou hast heard mc talk of my first essay in arms, how a noble English youth and I contended at Burgos:—now listen; it chanced that at Toulouse, unknowing who I was, this same brave knight chal¬ lenged thine own true Achmet. The challenge I accepted; but ere we fought, we recognised each other, and though we tried our utmost skill in our defence, yet neither had the heart to put forth all his strength. The contest was long, and at length tired ot' this
201
boy s play, we each resolved to termi nate, by one single blow the tedious tombât The result wae this, we both were thrown ' Hour after hour glided away unper teived by the two lovers, as question followed question, till at length Alı Taleb, surpnsed at their long confer tnee, joined them, and put an end to an interview which had lasted so long, «dthough Achmet declared it had ap¬ peared but of one hour s duration And now Ah led the way through tition gioves and shaded walks of mul bury trees, where loses perfumed the air «md shed a balmy fragrance round fresh lounts of water glittered in the sun and cooled the an, while the jasmine and the myrtle entwining round their base, unit mg beauty and perfume to the charm of coolness, invited them to repose be¬ neath their shade At length the time drew nigh when Achmet was compelled to quit again his lovely and beloved k5
202 Zenura; —yet he left not the palace till Ali had fixed the following month for their union. In a transport of delight, Achmet hastened to his father, and con¬ veyed the pleasing intelligence to Ma¬ homet, which now only wanted his sanction to be complete. Willingly the Moorish monarch, sanctioned the propo¬ sal of Ali ; and orders were given on thc following day, that preparations should be commenced, in order to render the celebration of these nuptials as splendid as possible. Yet, in the midst of this joy, Achmet did not forget his friend, Ravenspur. " The escort has departed," said Mahomet, " and they will straight be present at thy marriage. And now, my son, that I have despatched this bu¬ siness, and attended to thy happiness by this arrangement with Ali, thou must for a time attend to other matters." The King of Grenada then entered into a long account of the state of his kingdom and of the success of the Spa-

SOT
idea that Geraldine, the descendant of a noble race, and allied to one as noble, should appear at the Moorish court m a degree unbefitting her rank, gave a pang to hts heart, which her smiles upon this subject did but increase He had the moet unbounded faith in the honour of Achmet, but the latter could do but httle to assist him independently of hie father Yet he reasoned himself into something like content, and resolved patiently to await the result of his friend s journey to Grenada On the fifth morning after their ar rival, Jaques entered the apartment of his lord with a face so woebegone, that Ravenspur, whose lady was not pre sent, supposed some terrible accident had befallen her or his child Fortu nately Jaques fear» made him voluble, and, therefore, his lord did not long labour under the idea of so great a mis fortune " The house is beset, my lord, by
208 armed Moors," said the terrified Jaques, who, although he had faced death in a thousand ways, entertained such terrific ideas of the cruelty of the Moore, that his colour went and calne like that of .a frightened girl. " There is no means of escape left us," he added, " for the news at once spread through the city, and every man is our foe. This is likely to prove the last of our adventures. Oh, would to heaven we were in the hands of the robbers,—ay, even of Isidore, rather than these!"—At this moment Abnl el Aldedazera, the mer¬ chant, entered, and placing both his hands to his forehead, he bowed profoundly, saying, " Sir Knight, I have the commands of the King of the Faithful tö accommodate you with every thing you may want on your journey to thc capital of his dominions. In the chests in the next apartment you will find attire for your lady and child, as also for her female attendant. Two
209
litters are in attendance for them, with horses for yourself and other servants." Jaques did not quite comprehend all the Moor said ; but he could perceive by his respect, and the pleasure ex¬ pressed by his lord's countenance, that his fears were groundless. Ravenspur, having returned a suitable answer, re¬ paired to his lady, and imparted to her the joyful intelligence. " Peace awaits thee, my Geraldine, and rest for all thy sorrows. Mahomet, King of Grenada, offers us an asylum in his dominions ; and since I am con¬ demned to exile, and thy helplessness deprives me of the power of signalizing myself by seeking adventurous deeds, nowhere can I rest so well as in the bosom of friendship; the generous Achmet will be my companion, while thou shall find a friend in the gentle Zemira. See, my love, there is attire for thee, sent by Mahomet,—and, by my holidame, princely it is ;—but suits well
210
the generosity of the donor and thc beauty of the receiver. Thou wilt quickly equip thyself, for the guard which is to accompany us waits even now at the gate." The delighted Geraldine was well content to doff her humble robe, and attire herself in the splendid robes of a Moorish damsel ; and when her lord en¬ tered, he stopped an instant fixed in admiration of her lovely form, which never had appeared so bewitching. The trowsers were of the richest silk, full, and as she walked, scarcely to be dis¬ tinguished from a petticoat ; her shift, which was of the thinnest gauze, was drawn closely round the throat, and this ivas the only covering of her bosom ; round her waist she wore a broad sash, ivhich confined it, and was fastened by a jewelled clasp ; a robe of silk floated from her shoulders, and from the high turban, or cap, which adorned her head, fell a thin transparent veil, the counter-
211
part of that she wore at Toulouse, ex¬ cept that this was enriched by a more superb embroidery ; her arms were bare above the elbows, and the short sleeve was confined by a rich bracelet ; over these she wore long full gauze sleeves, which were closed to the elbow ; they were then parted and hung loosely down, the ends being embroidered like the veil, while at the two points was suspended a jewel of gold. Thus ar¬ rayed a cloak was thrown over, which concealed from every prying eye her personal beauty. The litter she enter¬ ed was lined with rose-coloured silk cushions, and the curtains were of the same materials. Young Richard Ra¬ venspur would not be separated from his mother, and into the litter he was lifted, where he amused himself with the gay covering of the vehicle and tho different parts of Geraldine's dress. Ravenspur rode close by his lady, and when they were not passing through
212
the towns she undrew the curtains of her litter, and viewed the surrounding scenery with delight : a Moorish land¬ scape pleases from its singularity ; the flat-roofed houses, the tops of which are adorned with flowers ; the gilded domes of the mosques, the picturesque effect of the burial-grounds, and above all, the luxuriance which adorned this part of Spain while it was still in the posses¬ sion of the Moors, drew from her expres¬ sions of the most unbounded admiration. Every spot of ground was cultivated : avenues of mulberry-trees fonned the boundaries of the high road ; the sides of the hills were planted as vineyards ; in the low grounds rice was sown, and the cotton-tree, the sugar-cane, and ma¬ ny ether vegetable treasures, now nn- kaown in that distracted country, were cultivated, and flourished abundantly. The upper parts of the mountains were feathered to their very summits by flow¬ ering shrubs; while others presented
213 dark musses of the solemn yew, and gracefully waving stone pine Giove» of citron and orange trees perfumed thc air, the level plains, watered by maje» tic rivers and numerous purling streams, glowed with the richness of the golden waving corn Innumerable cottages— thousands of oil mills—were scattered on every side* Such was the coun try through which oui travellers now journeyed, with an escort of fifty men as their protectors, every want sup plied, every wish grat.fied What a contrast to their peregrinations in (he South of France ' They wcie, in fact, arrived in Elysium after passing through Tartarus " Mais il faut passei par les panes pour arriver aux plaisirs^ " They had heard of the fairy palaces of Ara

What, then, was their surprise, when on ap¬ proaching an extensive and oddly form¬ ed red building, they were told, " that was the Alhambra." They had sup¬ posed, indeed, it was a place of impor¬ tance from the numerous Moorish sol¬ diers which appeared in its vicinity, from the throng of people who were seen going to and fro ; but that this was the Alhambra! —impossible! A small corner door was opened for their reception, through which our tra¬ veUers entered a court or square, con¬ taining a deep bath, filled with the purest water,—this was called the com-

217
most superbly attired, on his left, his pnncipal officers of state Geraldine accompanied her lord, but her veil was closed, yet the burning blush of mo¬ desty, which dyed her neck and cheek at appearing thus publicly in a place no one woman entered was distinguishable Mahomet welcomed them as a monarch, and as Ravenspur understood the Mo resco language, no interpreter was necessary The audience over— Ach met joined them, and told his friend, that in the evening there would be a concert, and that his father meant to introduce the Lady Geraldine to his Sultana " She is not my mother," he added she, alas ' is dead, but Zaplura is a lovely creature, and kmd too To morrow I shall conduct you to the pa lace of Ah Taleb, and there you shall see my Zemira Your servants will be accommodated in the palace, and I trust you will find every thing arranged as VOL III L
sie
much to your taste as our Moorish cus¬ toms will allow." Ravenspur expressed his thanks to Achmet for his hospitality, and then retired with Geraldine to the apartments appointed for his use Here every thing was splendid and voluptuous The cur tains of the apartment, which screened them from the sun, were of the most de¬ licate rose-colour, a marble bath was in the middle of one of the retiring apart ments, and jets of sweet water sprung from a fountain, and shed at once sweetness and coolness around The trellis windows were entwined with jas mine, honey-suckle, and roses, while sofas covered with the richest silk in¬ vited them to repose The roof was fretted, and the slender marble pillars, which surrounded the fountain, and uniting ere they reached the roof, form¬ ed a sort of open canopy, was carved in the most exquisite manner Yet nei-
219 ther Ravenspur nor lus lady wished to pass their days in this style of eastein magnificence they preferred the quiet way of living, which better suited their circumstances, but they did not choose to appear ungrateful to the princely con duct of their hosts, and therefore re solved for some time, at least, to remain as guests in the Alhambra Two or three females of the palace were de puted to attend upon Geraldine, and before the hour of the concert drew near, they entered, and having per fumed her hair and woven it in tresses they adorned the ends of it with pre cious stones, the most sumptuous trow¬ sers were then presented to her, as was also a jewelled zone in short, her dress was of the most costly kind At the proper time she was conducted to the music room The entrance to this room was through the most beautifully carved gate in the whole palace, and the view from this door was the most l2

222
ground, while the tinkling of the bells on their ancles marked how truly they kept time, and that what appeared the wild unpremeditated mazes ofthe dance was, in fact, the result of skill One of these dancing girls advanced alone, and with a light kanoon in her hand touched its strings, and produced sounds so witching, accompanied with a voice of exquisite sweetness, that Ravenspur was charmed, entranced, yet he wished him self away, and was not sorry when the sylph like figures vanished, and the Sultan rose to quit this apartment Geraldine in the mean while was as weary as her lord of thc voluptuous scene The Sultans seemed wholly en gaged in the contemplation of her own superb dress, and as Geraldine could not understand her language, she was soon tired of a pleasure which was so little connected with the mind She could not, however, but admire the con¬ tent and happiness which the Sultana
223
seemed to enjoy, and she formed an er roneous opinion of the Moorish women s abilities in general, from the frivolity of those she had this day witnessed But in this she erred Zaphtra the present empress, was the reverse of her prede cessor, the mmd of the latter was cast in a superior mould, and Mahomet found ш her a companion for his sober houis of thought while she lived he was faith ful to her, and caused her to be treated with every possible respect Many ol the Moorish women of those days added the graces of the mind to those of beauty, and attached their husbands to them, with an affection, age could not dimmish When Ravenspur joined Ins lady, she disencumbered herself of the most costly parts of her attire, and was conducted by Achmet to the gardens There every luxury was profusely spread aiound Vegetation poured forth her sweets on every side, marble fountains cooled the L 4

air, and groves of orange, myrtle, and citron, combined their influence to make this place a paradise. Here Ravenspur lingered till the moon threw her silvery light athwart the lovely scenery, while thousands of enamoured nightingales concealed in rose-bushes poured forth their plaintive tales to thc soft breeze of evening. The lofty Sierra Nevada formed the distant outline, while the intermediate space, thickly studded with cottages, presented a landscape at once calm yet animated. Thus ended the first day of their ar¬ rival at Grenada ; and Geraldine having visited her boy, retired to rest to dream of fountains, and groves, and lawns, and fairy palaces.

So much indeed was Geraldine charmed with her, that she entreated she might often be per¬ mitted to pay her respects to the in¬ tended bride of Achmet. Her flatter- L 5
226
ing request was received with delight by Zemira, and with the assistance of Ravenspur and Achmet, they soon un dcrstood each other sufficiently to con verse this was a pleasure to each not to be defined Yet day after day, Ra venspur and his lady sighed tor the liberty of independence, from which the walls of the splendid Alambra shut them out, an event however, happened ahout three weeks after their arrival, which induced Ravenspur to make known his intentions of quitting tho Moresco pa lace, and occupying some house in its vicinity Mahomet was surprised at the insen¬ sibility of the English knight to tht charms of the Moorish women Raven spur was as young as Achmet, who was three and twenty yet he viewed all thc voluptuous excitements of this " Arabian harem with indifference , and the Sul tan was resolved to tiy if he really were so insensible as he appeared He
227
therefore invited the knight to sup with himself alone, and at the hour appointed, Ravenspur repaired to the music chamber The evening was sul try yet these apartments were refreshed by the fountains, and in the conversa tion of Mahomet, Ravenspur passed a most delightful hour The room in which they sat being now enveloped m gloom, the lamps, placed in alabas ter vases, were lighted but the dis tant apartments receiving the moons full rays which streamed through the numerous windows, were still so tn lightened that the Sultan chose they should remain thus I enjoy this calm still hour, said Mahomet, the senses become attuned to harmony, and enjoy a luxuriant repose Besides I love to see the light foliage wave thus, and the tremulous light and shade they product is soothing, delicious, and entrancing yet methinks the pleasure would be en hanced, sir knight, if we had a black LÔ
328
eyed damsel to enliven us by her smiles ; and now, sir knight, as it were death for mortal ears to approach our privacy, permit me to inform you, that I have ordered a suite of apartments for you at a distance from those of your lady, when you feel disposed to amuse yourself with tho dancing girls." Ravenspur rose, then reseated him¬ self, and the Sultan, pretending not to observe him, proceeded thus : " I admire your lady—I think her exquisitely beautiful ; but still, sir knight, there are moments when you might find amusement in viewing the mazes of the dance, or listening to the witching power of sounds. I have in my palace a Circassian of such exqui¬ site skill in dancing and music, that she is matchless, besides which her beauty is unparalleled ; and as a mark of my unbounded friendship, I intend to con¬ fer her upon you." Ravenspur now rose to his full height,
229
as he refused in the most grateful but yet the most decided tones, the honour intended htm Mahomet laughed ex ceedingly at the seriousness of the knight, and touching a small spi ing, the most delicious music instantly floated on the air, now it swelled, then died away,—when the notes of the nightm gale, at first heard faintly, would use on the breeze, till her melodious voice was again overpowered by the strains ot ethereal beings, as it should seem, since the lyre was touched by an invisible magic hand, and the form of her who, after a pause sung a beautiful solo, was unseen " Tıs she, sir knight, said the Sultan to Ravenspur, who forgot every thing that Mahomet had said to him ' tıs she—what think you oHier powei of song t ' Ravenspui started from his reverie Once he thought he had heard the tones before but ashamed of his momentary abstraction, he was going to reply, when

the Sultan interrupted him—" Yonder she comes,' he said, pointing to the lattice of the large window, which ter minated the long enfilade we have al ready mentioned, and at this moment the lattice opened, and in the bright moonlight stood a figure enveloped in a thick veil, yet so tastefully arranged as to display the symmetry of its form Ravenspur in vain looked round for a place of retreat, and heedless of the raillery of Mahomet, he stood immove able Music again floated on the distant breeze, and the figure advancing slowly appeared like a being of another world so softly did it seem to glide through thc suite of apartments, ever and anon disappearing as the arches cast then deep shade upon it, then again emerg ing into the bright moon beams, it seem ed more bright, more heavenly than before At length the king approached it, and the figure extending her hand, he took it, and led her, with an arch

and exulting smile towards Ravenspui who retreated bowing till he reached the extremity of the music chamber and as he could not vanish through the wall he was there compelled to remain and in a state of pmgatory too not to be de scribed Mahomet had now reached the middle ofthe chamber and the figuit was en veloped in a glow from the innumerable lamps which were placed m various parts of the music room and the Sultan led her on till she approached close to the knight to whom he addressed a short speech enumerating the beauties and qualifications of the fair Circassian who now knelt at Ravenspur s feet Ra venspur summoned all his resolution to ljlg aid as he turned away from the veiled slave who was bade by the Sul tan to ause and follo v her future loid The slave obeyed and Ravenspur re treating made the circuit of the room but at length he stopped and very re
232 spectfully told the Sultan, thathe should conceive any further perseverance on his part was intended as an insult, and beg ged leave to retire " Have a care," said Mahomet, " my lord of Ravenspur, you know not the rules of this palace, if you quit this chamber, you renounce the Circassian for ever, and she is mine by all the laws of love Think well ere you speak again " Ravenspur strode haughtily towards the next apartment, as he said, " I have no claim upon her, and relinquish hei for ever ' But the Circassian darted after him, and flinging off the veil, Geraldine exclaimed, " What renounce me for ever' " Pie, fie, ' said the king, you havt spoiled all " But I could not bear, said Geraldine, blushing, " he should repeat his renunciation oí me foi ever ' Did you fear I should take htm at his woid, replied the king ' Well,
233
well, I see by the sparkle of his eye, that I must not hope to win so fair a prize But, lady, it was a dangerous trial Few could stand it—and did you feel no fears}—no doubts, fair lady ' " My hopes overbalanced them,' was tbe reply, and my faith in his truth and loyalty outweighed them Mahomet smiled, and said, " Truly, sir knight, thou art worthy so rich a gem as tnis, and she of thee Believe me, lady, we Moors are true, and having more temp tation, have greater merit than your Christian knights You pardon me this fraud, good Ravenspur'" " Not quite, ' replied the knight, with a smile, but it was not the smile of gaiety Ravenspur indeed felt the king had no nght to put his virtue to so great trial Geraldine looked alarmed, and Mahomet felt somewhat piqued at the serious air of Ravenspur, who, however, soon regained his composure, and m the delightful garden of the Alhambra they
234
passed the ensuing hour, and then with¬ drew to their several apartments. On the following week the ceremony of Achmet's nuptials were to be solemn¬ ized, when the greatest magnificence was to be displayed. Notice had been sent to many of the neighbouring Chris¬ tian courts announcing a solemn tour¬ nament to grace the occasion, and se¬ veral knights from France and Italy had arrived at Grenada to break a lance with the Moors. This was a sport which seemed to restore Ravenspur to his forfeited rank; and to be again in arms, was to be Ri¬ chard Ravenspur, the descendant of Hilderbrand, Lord Ravenspur, whose fame of deeds in arms had reached from Palestine to England. Anxiously did he therefore expect thc day ; but he entered the lists as an unknown knight. Several times he bore off the prize. The splendour exhibited at this fete exceeded all that the imagi-
235
nation can picture. The costume of the Arabs, when of superior rank was rich, costly, and graceful ; their horses were of the finest breed, and their ca¬ parisons sumptuous to a great degree. The grace and agility which they dis¬ played were indiscribable, and few were the prizes borne off by the Christians on this memorable day, when Zemira, as presiding lady of the sports, bestowed the prize, which became beyond all price from liaving passed through her hands. The delighted Achmet excelled his peers in these acts ; and Zemira, proud of his valour and his love, seemed to acquire a degree of dignity in her manner, which never afterwards left her. Ravenspur was now more anxious than ever to have a home ofhis own, and he quitted the palace one day to dispose of his jewels, in order to enable him to make the purchase of some quiet spot, where he and his Geraldine could
236
spend their days in peace and retire ment As he passed through the city m a Moorish dress, he was unnoticed by the ciowd, who would otherwise have molested him by their inquisitive gaze Having ascertained the lesidence of a wealthy Jew, he repaned to his house, and proposed patting with tho jewels in question for a fair price Sheeva, the Jew, looked at them atten tively, and then at Ravenspur, said the device was Christian—" You are a Christian yourself" " It matters little who or what I am, ' replied Ravenspur, " I want money for these jewels you werp recommended to me as a fair deal¬ ing man, and to you I offer them The Jew bowed lowly, and protested he would give the utmost value for them, always allowing himself a small clear profit ' " That is what I require, ' resumed Ravenspur, " but what is the value' The Jew pondered, and mentioned a
237
sum, which the knight accepted, and the bargam being thus struck, Raven spur received the money, and then asked Sheeva, " if he could inform him of a dwelling-house in the vicinity of the city, which he could purchase ' ' " I do not know of any one at pre sent—but I will ask my daughter," re plied Sheeva, " She goes about a good deal, and she can tell us Rachel, my dear, come here—Can you tell the gen¬ tleman of a house ' " Thtie is one at the back of the titran grove, ' replied Rachel, a beauti ful girl of the middle size, with eyes as black as sloes, and hair of the raven hue. " There is a cottage there, which Zayda, the widow of poor Omar, would be glad to sell " " Put on thy veil, child, and lead the gentleman to the spot, ' said Sheeva " It is a good child," he added, as she left the room, " it is a good child, dutiful and affectionate, charitable to all
238
—she ıs a skilful leach too—Heaven bless her, she has scarcely recovered the fatigue of nursing Omar " Rachel entering the apartment, put an end to the parental praise of the father, and leading the way she con¬ ducted Ravenspur along the banks of the Xeni (a branch of the Guadalquiver, which washes the walls of Grenada,) to a citron grove, at the further extremity of which stood a romantic cottage, em¬ bosomed in a wilderness of sweets Charmed with the beauty of the spot, Ravenspur concluded a bargain with Zayda to her perfect satisfaction " But, said the knight, turning to Rachel, " Zayda will grieve to quit this spot " Necessity compels her, ' replied Ra¬ chel ' The sum she has now pro cured, will enable her to commence a small merchandise, and she and her chil¬ dren will then have a provision for their future as well as their present wants ' " Till they get a dwelling,' said Raven
239
spur ' they shall not remove Oui fa mily ıs small, and we can accommodate her with a part of the house. And now, good Rachel, as you seem to live to be useful to society, as well as adorn it, perhaps you can supply my other wants We shall need assistance in our house hold—canst thou tell mc of a trusty Moor and his wife, who could superintend the toncerns of our small establishment Three men and one maid are all we have, and they know little of the Moor ish language , therefore we shall be dis tressed I cannot say I do, answered Ra chel, ' but I will endeavour to find such persons for you, and when I have succeeded, how shall I let you know the result of my inquines' Inquire at the palace for the English knight, rejoined Ravenspur Rachel looked surprised, but made no reply, except by a low obeisance, and Raven
240
spur, instead of returning home, went to thc palace of Ah—to his friend Ach met To lum he declared his intentions and entreated he Would inform Mahomet of his anxiety to quit the palace, and live retired " He will be vexed, said Achmet, " but not prevent your purpose how¬ ever I will make known your wishes, and explain to him, that the mode of life is so entirely different to that pur sued in your own country, that it is being twice banished not to be able to follow some of those customs familia to you, and now doubly endeared bj thc melancholy idea of their being lost to you for ever in your native land Ravenspur then returned ι nme, and communicated to his lady the result of his mornings excursion She was de lighted to hear they were likely to have a home of their own, and her thoughts, as was usual when an idea of comfort
241
and security was presente.' to her ima¬ gination, wandered instantly to Eng¬ land, and her little girl. " As soon as we are settled, dear Ra¬ venspur," she replied to her lord's com¬ munication, " we will send Robert to England, and have tidings of our child, if it is not advisable to send for her here." " True, my love," said Ravenspur ; but if she is well and happy, I should be unwilling to have her here. Times may alter here as well as in England ; and the Moorish power is so tottering, that I tremble to increase our cares, if necessity should compel us to seek an¬ other asylum." Jaques at this moment entered the apartment, saying that Ro¬ bert was suddenly taken ill.—" Send instantly—stay, I will go myself," in¬ terrupted Ravenspur ; " I will be back anon, and bring assistance." He hasten¬ ed accordingly to Sheeva's house, and solicited the attendance of Rachel. She
242 immediately accompanied him, and with modest guise and step entered the lofty palace of the Moorish king. She no sooner saw the patient, than she pro¬ nounced in Ravenspur's ear that his dis¬ order was mortal. " He will not live the night through. I have no power to check this rude disease ; it would baffle the skill of our sagest matrons, my presence here is of no avail." •She was retiring, when Geraldine en¬ tered the apartment, brought thither by her anxiety for the fate of »faith¬ ful domestic. Rachel stopped to gaze upon her for the divinity of pity, which animated the soft eye of the lady ; the tear which hung upon her fringed eyelid was in the eyes of the Jewess a pearl of inestima¬ ble value. Geraldine eagerly inquired how Ro¬ bert ci " ?—but the look of Rachel was enough, and the former left the apart¬ ment, and the latter returned home.
243 Robert was soon insensible of all pain, and before the morning he had breathed his last. His body was conveyed out of the palace secretly, and interred pri¬ vately in the neighbourhood. Achmet having made Ravenspur's de¬ sire known to the king his father, the latter expressed some surprise at the request : " but I have heard," he said, " of the independent spirit of the Eng¬ lish nobles, and must therefore only regret, that my favours have been so bestowed as to have assumed the ap¬ pearance of imposing a heavy yoke of obligation. Tell him, however, my son, that I honour his independence, and that I shall expect his presence at court occasionally. Bear this jewel to him as a pledge of my future friendship, and assure him, that it must be circumstances alone which can never occur, which could induce me to relinquish his friend¬ ship." This princely conduct was duly ap-
ш preciated by Ravenspur and his lad) By this one act he had rivetted them more to his interests than by all he had done before. On the day following they quitted their sumptuous abode, and entered a dwelling of their own—a dwelling which Mahomet himself might have envied, for it was the peaceful abode of content

Ín this abode of peace Ravenspur and his lady passed ΰιβ following year, to¬ wards the end of which Thomas, who had been despatched to England, re-
246
turned with intelligence that the little Gertrude was well and happy ; that the lady Ravenspur treated her in every re¬ spect like her own child, and that she was as lovely and as beautiful as her mother. Thomas having withdrawn, Ravenspur observed " that as they could have fre¬ quent intelligence of Gertrude's welfare, he could wish that she should remain in England." " I am not anxious," he added, " that she should visit this land of splendour and magnificence ; this land of pleasure and voluptuousness. I trust times will change, and that we shaU again visit our native land. Richard is, I understand, fast undermining his authority, and report «peaks loudly of many secret conspiracies ;—would to heaven, I could prevent them; but the hope is vain. Yet my heart bleeds for my native Und ; for Richard too, blind and self-willed, as he hag al¬ ways proved himself. Bolingbroke is
2*7
still in France, and there he broods over his ivrongs; and he has friends who will sometimes prove themselves as such." From three to iota yeara passed ой in this quiet manner, and nothing parti¬ cular occurred ; but, about that period, a stranger demanded admittance to the English knight. He wore a Moorish drees, and led a boy by the hand about ten years of age, whose countenance spoke a deep dejection. " İ am eome ftom the neighbourhood of Toulouse," said the man, " you have not forgotten Martin, I suppose." Ravenspur in an instant recognised the robber who had proved a friend. " Foigotten Martin!" he exclaimed, " I should deserve Martin should forget me." He theu fixed his eyes on thé boy. " It is Rinaldini'» boy—but enter Martin, and tell me all: is RinaldiniV-— ," " ïwill tell you all," replied the robber, " but tet not this pool 1 boy hear it.''
248
Ravenspur took hold of Rinaldini's hand and conducted him to Geraldine, and bade her sooth his sorrows, for the tears of the noble boy had burst forth in torrents, when Ravenspur began his query. Geraldine composed his agi¬ tation, but his feelings were too deeply wounded to enter into those sports which were in unison with his age, and the mirth of young Richard, who was now neat eight years old, oppressed his spirits and made him choose a retired corner of the apartment as a refuge from the noisy mirth ofthe boy. The robber, in the meanwhile, was detailing to Ravenspur the fate of the unfortunate'Rinaldini. " We continued," he thus began, " in the neighbourhood of Toulouse even till now ; and, at this moment, the moun¬ tains are occupied by a party of our people. About four months ago, a mutiny broke out amongst us, headed by Isidore, whose genius, fierce and
249
savage as it ivas, bowed to that of Ri naldım, although there were times when it strovf for the mastery Your escape pioduced a quarrel between them, words ran high, but Rinaldini ordered him into confinement, and this storm blew over Frequently, however, the rob bei chief needed all his sell'posse¬ sion to subdue the spirit of a man who never owned obedience but to hnn Some six months back, however, a dis pute arose about the division of a booty taken from some pilgrims and a party ot monks, who were travelling towaids Maiseilles, there to embark for Loietto Isıdoıe feigned, however, content at last, and the matter, to all appearance was made up yet, so revengeful wis his disposition, that Rinaldini had, toi some time, slept in the same cave ь I did, with his boy, and his suspicions of treachery and dangei, weie but too well founded One night I was awak ened from my sloep by a scream from ч5
650
the boy, and opening my eyes, I started from the ground, for young Rinaldini was running after some oné with hie father's dagger in his hand, and just at the door, Isidore turned round and aimed a blow at the dauntless boy, who would have still gone on had I not stopped him. He struggled hard to get away, while he gave vent to his pas¬ sion by tears and screams. I was at a loss to account for his conduct, when a groan stole upon my ears, and, the boy darting from me, rushed upon his dying father's bosom and sobbed aloud, now calling upon his parent in the most soothing accents, then calling violently on Isidore. My attention was now how¬ ever directed to Rinaldini himself, who placing the boy's hand within mine, bade me repair with him to Grenada, and find you out, according to the ful¬ filment of your promise, adding, that the present and future elevation of his son depended upon you."
251
Ravenspur then asked Martin what he meant to do himself?" " Not to resume my former life," was the reply, " but to end my days in pe¬ nitence and prayer. 1 intend entering a monastery, if I can procure admission into one ; and if you have no objection. Sir Knight, I should think the young and fiery Rinaldini could not find a better asylum. If he remains in the world he will be assailed by innumerable temptations, but his ardent temper pro¬ perly directed may, in time, make a saint." Ravenspur agteed to the probability of this reasoning, and he resolved him¬ self to convey young Rinaldini to a mo¬ nastery in Castile, with the superior of which he was well acquainted. Having therefore informed Achmet of his inten¬ tions he left Geraldine and his boy, under the roof of his friend, and per¬ formed this act of friendship for the «fl
252 sake of the unfortunate and misguided Rinaldini, who was now no more. Upon his return, he again resumed the quiet life of a cottager, except that he frequented the court upon occasions of state, and always was a competitor, when a tournament was held at Grenada or any of the neighbouring cities. Once with Jaques he visited Milan and paid his respects to the duke, but in private presenting Victorine's ring as a passport —upon this occasion he was accompa¬ nied by his son, then a youth of about sixteen, who received the most maiked attention from the duke. The following year, Sheeva the Jew, with whom he had formed a kind of acquaintance, at least as much so as the enmity between that unhappy people and the christians would permit, was announced. The Israelite asked ear¬ nestly, " if any one were within hear¬ ing."
253
' No, replied Ravenspur, " you may in safety speak ' One of my tnbt then," resumed the Jew, ' is just ie turned from England and p,issing through France, he had occasion to see the duke of Lancaster " Laucastci m France' exclaimed Ravenspur, ' what brought him theie' ' Listen, said Sheeva, " old Lanças ttr is dead, and Bolingbroke lias as sumed his father s title, which Ricbaid icfuses to sanction, and withholds also all the estates and property an nexed to that title Bolingbiokt has indignantly demanded reinstatement in his rights and piopeitie», and the nobles of the noith, whom Richard has ot tended by ι anous acts of oppression, are leady to take up arms in delence ot tht banished duke, and the restor ıtıoıı ol the rights of Englishmen This seciet he confided to the keeping of I ubai with a stuet injunction to find you out ind impart these great events to youi
254
private ear. Now is the time for you to regain your rank and property ; but circumstances of more importance claim your care. When in England, business carried our brother to the north, and at Ravenspur he was wind-bound for se¬ veral days. There he learnt from va¬ rious reports, that the present Earl of Ravenspur and his lady were exceed¬ ingly uneasy, for some of their scouts from abroad in pursuit of you, were of late returned, declaring you were alive, though they know not where. Tubal leamt this at an inn, and knowing that he could gain admittance through your name, he went to the monastery and declared to Father Andrew you were well, and in high favour at the court of Mahomet, where you had sought refuge from the pursuit of your brother. The old Abbot wept for joy at hearing this, bade Tubal call on the morrow, and gave him this. Our brother is on the point of journeying again to Eng-
253 land, and if you have ought to send, will bear it faithfully Yet, ш good sooth, I had forgotten the most import ant part of his message ' " Let me see him instantly," said Ravenspur, " my anxiety will prompt the questions which may elicit answers of importance ' Sheeva bowed low, and, hastening away in search of Tubal—he soon re tuined, introducing his biother Ravenspur, in the mean while, had bugan perusing Father Andrew s epistle, which referred him, indeed, to Tubal for information which it was dangerous to commit to paper " You have, I find, seen the lady Gertrude, asked Ravenspur, impa¬ tiently—" she is well'—yet her con dition is not free from sorrow'—tell me, good Tubal, all «you know about her " The fathei Ambrose," said the Jew, 1 notwithstanding my being a Jew, list-
256
ened to my tale , and, more than list ened, he believed me, and confided to iny keeping that, but whicli for the lovely ladys sake, I would not have touched, when I saw your daughtei, my heart melted into tenderness, for I thought of my own child Deborah and how glad I should be to have a token from her, if she were separate fiom me and I picked up these beads, winch she dropped to me over the cliff, by tht Father's orders—who had contrived the Lady Abbess should invite hei to the convent She is a lovely creature, and the monk bade me tell you, that the lady Angelina is anxious to unite her to her son, a fiery youth, and was not so kind as she was wont " Ah ' indeed t ejaculated Raven spur—" proceed, good Tubal " And he bade me say, resumed the Isiaehte, ' that if you, or your lady, tould come immediately to England- she might be sent abroad, but that lit
257
feared to trust her to any one but your self I am returning instantly—if the lady would accompany me, I would pledge my lite, and that of Dorothy, for her safety · Ravenspur heard no more, but went in search of Geraldine, and in a few words unfolded the story of Tubal Ge raldinc was impatient instantly to depart, with Jaques and Thomas, and Tubal Gertrude unhappy t —there was not an instant to be lost Achmet provided horses for their conveyance to the sea shore and, after a prosperous voyage, they landed at Marseilles They, how¬ ever, avoided the road to Toulouse, and, bearing a little northward, proceeded with all possible despatch to Bourdeaux, where they again embarked, and reached the north of England, without mishap Here Geraldine was admitted into the convent by the lady Abbess, and per sonated thc nun who so much interested Gertrude Ravenspur, in the mean
258
while, having disposed of his property in Spain, bent his steps toward France, with the hopes of finding Bolingbroke. The latter was, however, gone to Eng¬ land ; and the banished Ravenspur, hiring a vessel in Flanders, sailed for his native land, accompanied by his son, a spirited youth of seventeen. It was them whom Gertrude watched in the storm, and caused the anxiety of the nun. At night, the latter was per¬ mitted to quit the convent; but as the superstition of the nuns was great, she clothed herself in her own dress, lest she should be seen, flattering herself that she might be mistaken for a ghost. Her plan, as we have seen, succeeded. She had two interviews with her hus¬ band, who, thinking his wife and daughtei in perfect safety at the con¬ vent, repaired to Bolingbroke. He, however, no sooner received intelligence of the disappearance of his daughter, than he returned to Ravenspur, and,
SS9
leaving his lady, he went to the neigh¬ bourhood of Fitzhugh There they learnt the sudden departure of the Earl of Ruvenspur and his family, and, ac compamed by Clod and Father Andrew, they pursued the fugitives As, however, they appioached the object of then pursuit, it was judged proper to leave the two latter at an adjacent town, as well as thc pnncipal part of their suite, in order to appear less formidable, and to avoid exciting suspicion Then tbs appointment we have already detailed, and now it remains for us to account for the secretion of Gertrude, and the troubles and sorrows she was compelled to encounter, as well as the peregrina¬ tions of young Richard in search of his sister Geraldine had slowly bent her steps to the castle of Kavenspur, as the fatigues and anxieties she had lately undergone were beyond her strength her health was, consequently, so much
200
aifected that, at the earnest entreaties of her lord, she had forborne to accom¬ pany them on their expedition, as her presence would have greatly impeded their progress As the time for their return approached, her anxiety led her to fix herself at the window of one of the highest turrets of the castle There she sat, her eyes fixed on the distant hoiizon, watching from morn till night, that she might see the joyous cavalcade approach as far as eye " could ken " What then was her disappointment at beholding her lord, alone, and slowly approaching the castle A thousand fears rushed upon her mind, and eie Ravenspur had confirmed them, her ex haustcd frame sunk under this bitterest of sorrows, and she fell senseless Restored to sensation, and with it to anxiety, her lord's efforts to console her were, for a long time, ineffectual, and the arrival of Father Andrew and Clod did but confirm her worst fears, which
2fil
were these —that ııı order to secure to young Richard Ravenspur the Titzhugh estates, and to prevent all possibility of resentment on their part, Angelina had resol ved to uni te her son and niece m «ed lock—that she would use her utmost en deavours to accomplish this nefarious scheme, there was little doubt, and that she might effect it by stratagem or force, « as not less probable Every thing, in deed.was to be dreadedfrom the character ofthe Italian, and so great was the grief of Geraldine, that Ravenspur, who was anxious to quit England in scaich ot his daughter, felt it impossible to leave the tastle while his lady was in her present dangerous state Compelled, therefore, by circumstances, to be pas sive, when his inclination led lum lo bc most active, he awaited the result of his sons departure with feelings but little inferior to those of Geraldine her self
262 In this state of suspense, we must leave them, and return to Gertrude, whom we left overwhelmed with appre¬ hension, as to what the morrow, alluded to by Father Rupert, was to bring forth.

CHAP \Ш Arthur —Alas ! what need yo j be so bnist rous rough * I «vill not struggle 1 will stand stone still- Fur heaven β sake Hubert, let u e not be liouud Nay hear me, Hubert Kinq John When Gertrude arose from her couch on the morning following that day, which so uncvpectedly tore her from her friends m the convent, she was for some time incapable of perfect recol¬ lection The visions of the yesterday flitted before her imagination like the visions of a fearful dream, and the hrst words she spoke, when she recovered her faculties, were strongly expressive of htr apprehensions of the future " I am a prisoner then, and in the power of Father Rupert Oh heavens! defend me ' but of all men in the world, he is
264,
the one 1 most dread. But the morning dawns," she added after a pause, and springing from her bed, " Ah that to¬ night were come, and yet, perhaps, I shall then but be convinced to a cer¬ tainty of that wretchedness, which now I only apprehend." As she spoke, the arras was slowly raised and Father Rupert entered. " Follow me, daughter," said the monk, holding up the arras, and pointing to a narrow passage. For an instant Ger¬ trude hesitated; if she quitted that chamber, how should she obtain inteUi¬ gence from Clod, yet how to resist the Father's orders, was a question she could not solve ; and at the repetition of his command she heaved a deep sigh and obeyed. The passage they entered, was ex¬ ceedingly narrow, and by no mean» long; it terminated at a small square apartment, which had no window, nei¬ ther any other door, but one, a lamp
265
was suspended from thc middle of this apartment, the floor was covered with matting, and the walls were hung with a thick kind of grey serge a small table stood in the middle of thc room, and in one corner of it was a mattress with a rude coverlid thrown over it a crucifix, and a book of hours, lay on the table, (for Gertrude had been taught to read,) and two wooden chairs com pleted the furniture of the solitary dwelling place Gertrude started back at thc door of entrance, it so forcibly recalled to her imagination the picture of fiie room said to be under thc con vent of Ravenspur, as a receptacle for nuns who had grossly transgressed then vow that she apprehended a similar fate awaited her The colour fled her cheek her limbs totteied under her, and she fell nearly senseless at Father Ruperts feet speech was denied her, yet her clasped hands and the elo vol m N
266
qucnce of upraised eyes, told her ap¬ prehensions to the monk, who had pos sibly presided at a scene so appalling as that thc bare apprehension of which, had thus palsied the poweis of Ger trude " Rise, daughter," said he, extending his hand to raise her, " why should you be thus agitated, your abode in this retired apartment will be short, and since you have brought this punishment upon yourself, learn to submit at once to that confinement, which it is in vain to resist Rise and enter the apartment prepared for you, where your comfort has been attended to, though," he added, with a smile, fiom which she shiunk, " care has been taken to pre vent your holding any further commu nication with the doughty knight-er rant—Clod ' The concluding sarcasm of this speech roused Gertrude to a sense of what was
267 due to herself, and she arose and walked with assumed composure into the dread td apartment " With respect to your conduct in this apartment, I have but a few words of advice you must observe a Silence most profound Though I am absent, yet remember, walls may have ears, your former apartment is occupied by one devoted to my mtenst There is no egress from this apartment except through that, if, therefore, you wish to retain the sole possession of your pre sent place of confinement, yoa /ılı re fram from opening your lips let what will occur within your hearing Your food will be brought regularly to you, you need have no apprehensions on that account, and for the rest, a short time will release you from your present irksome situation I leave you, (laugh ter, for the piesent but, remember, that the smallest inclination on your part to break through my commands may n2
368
place you in a situation, to which your present one will appear a paradise.'' As the Father said this, he left the apartment, and Gertrude listened, with breathless sensation, to the sliding of the pannel which gave him entrance into her former apartment. The stillness which now surrounded her, the dark¬ ness of night in mid-day, and the feeble rays of the lamps which did but illume the middle of her small apartment, com¬ bined to sink her spirits to a fearful degree. Imaginary terrors assailed her, slie dared scarcely move her eyes, lest by so doing she should fix them on some terrific object: at length, quite over¬ powered by terror, her head sunk upon her bosom, and in this position she re¬ mained until she heard footsteps in the adjoining passage. Even Father Ru¬ pert's voice she longed to hear, and she rose from her seat and met, not him, at the door, but Nicolai. Nicolai was then the occupier of thc
369
adjoining apartment, she shrimk back, as he advanced in silence, and placed upon the table some refreshment, and then as silently withdrew. Till this moment Gertrude had shed no tear, but her heaving bosom now found relief in those drops of melting softness, to which the stoutest hearts have yielded, and which alike are soothing, to our own and other's woe. At eventide as she sup¬ posed, Nicolai returned, not with re¬ freshment, but apparently as a guard, for he took his seat in the apartment with herself, after closing the door. He did not speak a word, but rose repeatedly, and went towards the door; once he opened it, and then Gertrude fancied she could distinguish Clod's voice quite near her. Again she heard it, and rushing forward, had nearly gained the pannel, ere Ni¬ colai overtook her, and by drawing her veil closely over her face, partly drowned the scream which sounded faintly on N 3
270
the fool's ears ; in nature's mute but expressive, language Gertrude implored his pity, but Nicolai's heart was not to be moved by woman's tears : her sup¬ plicating hands, and prostrate posture, made no impression upon his obdu¬ rate heart. AU he seemed anxious about, was to keep the veil closely over her lips ; he made one attempt to force her to return, but he did not repeat it, as the noise produced, might, he feared, excite suspicion. When, however, he heard Clod close the outer door, he stooped to raise her, but her strong feel¬ ings of indignation, however, gave her strength, and she burst from his hold, and knocked violently against the pan- nel. " Respect," said the ruffian, " must yield to necessity," and he approached to take hold of her, but Gertude finding escape was useless, eluded his grasp, and entered her own apartment closing ihe door after her. " Oh with all my heart," said Nicolai,
271
as the door shut to against him, " with all my heart. I have no wish to intrude myself upon you, young lady. All I have to attend to, is that nobody else shall have that rare felicity—You had better take a nap ; you have a long journey to perform before morning, it is an example I shall set you ; although this passage is none of the pleasantest. But thank heaven, I shall soon enjoy myself in my own country, where these matters are more easily managed : such a fuss indeed about a foolish mawkish girl, why ifl were Lord Henry, I would scorn to wed where I might command. Women hate your tender-hearted love¬ sick fools; they like men of spirit. When I was oaf enough to go a wooing, my words \?ere few, and if the silly elf were pleased to take me, well and good, if not, I went further a field. Father Rupert's plans with regard to Gertrude, had been all arranged, and settled previous to the arrival of Father
272
Andrew and Clod ; and about midnight Nicolai entered her apartment, and bid¬ ding her put on a large cloak, which he presented to her, he pointed to the door saying, " You will follow me, lady, and quietly too ; there is no sort of use in making a fuss, go you must, and there¬ fore the freer you go, the more agree¬ able will be the journey. AU now in the castle are retired to rest ; you may, to be sure, do as you ple.ise, but as you seem to think my touch has something very terrific in it, you know how to avoid it, that's all." Gertrude did indeed feel that there would be no use in resistance, and she put on the cloak, and with a heavy sigh, followed her conductor into the room, she formerly occupied. Nicolai crossed it, and lifting the arras, not where it opened into the corridor, but near tho outer wall, he then opened a door, and holding forwards a lamp, he cried, " The stairs is deep and narrow, gather
273
your cloak close to you, lady, and de¬ scend carefully ; I will follow." Gertrude seeing no help nigh obey ed, though with difficulty ; and upon ar¬ riving at the foot of this winding de¬ scent, Nicolai advanced before her, and opened another door. The night-air met her cheek fresh and chill. Nicolai having advanced a step or two, looked carefully on each side ; then returned and extinguishing the lamp, bade his companion emerge«.from the castle and mount a mule, which was fastened to a staple in the wall, while he did the same. They then commenced their journey, and pursued it in silence for some time ; the night was not absolutely stormy, but the light fleecy clouds occasionally concealed the brightness of the moon, and shed a melancholy uncertainty upon the surrounding objects. Gertrude mused as she went along upon the uncertainty of her present and future fate, which appeared in unison n5
274
with the gloom of the night Her hopes wcie like the bright and transient beam» of the moon, which scarcely were no sooner visible than they were con cealed by the clouds ot disappointment Long time they journeyed, at length Nicolai said, " I suppose you begin to be weary, lady, but you must take cou rage for a time, shortly you will have a horse litter Another silence followed, and they wound through the Unes care fully and slowly 'jll they entertd a common The moon was now com pletely hidden, and л small drizzling rain began to fall, the wind whistled mournfully, and Gertrude s spirits, de pressed to the utmost degree, found rchet in teais She wept in silence, and hei mind taking a retrospective view, looked back to the days of her m fancy with regret If she had never known the fostering care of a mother, nor ever felt the delight of kindred love, yet she had found delight in the affec
275
tion of Robert and Margery, and would gladly have been content to have found shelter in some peasant's cot with peace and innocence for her companions, far fiom the guilt and power of those who usurped so tyrannous an authority over her When they arrived about the middle of the common, they found a man hold¬ ing two horses, the one bearing a hoise litter, he spoke not, neither did Ni¬ colai, but the latter advancing, assisted Gertrude to alight and get into the litter The man who held the horses, led the mule away, and Nicolai having himself got ontlie other horse, rode off at a busk pace Gertrude observed that the serv¬ ing man avoided every town, and that he followed the most unfrequented paths Thus they journeyed till the heat of the sun became intense, and Nicolai turning out of the road, entered a fo¬ rest, and fastening the horses in the nC
276
only spot where he could make them enter, he assisted Gertrude to alight, and offered her refreshment The con duct of this fellow was respectful enough—though he was upon the alert, that no circumstance sliould interrupt what he conceived to be the perform ance of his duty, and upon peiceiving a wood-cutter at a little distance, lit bade Gertrude re enter her litter " So soon'" said the weaned gnl, "resta shoit time longer" "No, lady,' replied Nicolai, asthe woodman advanced, " you must imme¬ diately enter the litter But Gertrude had caught sight of this man, and she resolved to make an effort for her release , she therefore refused to entei the litter, and as Nicolai ap proached hei in a thieatening attitude, the man called out to lnm asking " What ivas the matter ' "Oh, kind fellow,' said Gcitrudc* springing towards him, " issist me to
277
escape from the power of this man, who is carrying me away from my friends Gertrude, in the energy of the moment, had grasped the peasant s arm and hei cloak fell back, and disclosed to his astonished gaze, the dress of a novice of St Dommick " You may well stare, observed Nicolai, " you see what sort of friends she pretends I have taken her from, but the fact speaks for itself, she her self fled from a convent " It is false," said Gertrude intei rupting him " Oh believe lnm not Gladly would I return to Ravenspui nunnery oh do not—do not believe him, assist me to return thithei " Nicolai smiled sarcaslicilly, as he ad dressed the peasant thus, " You may if you like, interfere with me in the pti foimance of my duty, but you know tht danger of intoirupting the decrees ol so powerful a body of monks as the Dominicans—she is condemned for her
278
crime to be sent to a convent abroad— death was thc sentence, but it was softened to banishment, now do as you like I am prepared to stand your at¬ tack, and if you aie such a fool as to be afftcted by the sighs and teais ol a whimpering girl, and believe hei silly tale—come on " Nicolai drew fiom beneath his cloak a dagger, and cxln bited by this movement, anothei wea pon of the same kind, as well as a good long sword The peasant hesitated— tlie stone» were so difleient and coi tamly the monks of St Dommick wen powerful, and to fall under their juris diction, was not very agreeable. So after a few minutes ponderation, he re »olvcd to be a heio on the stiongest side , having therefore given Nicolai a nod, he doffed his hat to Gertrude, and lesuming his song, which their appeai¬ anee had ititi: ìruptcd, he picked up hia bundle of fagots and quitted the forest
279
Gertrudes heart swelled with indíg nation «it his cowaidly desertion of her, and winding her cloak round lier, she passed hastily by Nicolai, and enteied the litter without his assistance Sht scorned to open her lips to him, but haughtily drew the curtam» of her littei close, and in tear» lamented her hope less fate She had no one to look to foi assistance, no one, as she thought to interest themselves m her fate It would have been »orne consolation to hei, had she known how many powerful Inends wen at this vi ry moment either ш puisuit of her, or planning schemes lor her ichef The only beings she thought mteiested in hci fate, were thc poor fool Clod, and Father Nicholas Margery, too would lament hcı depar tuie, and the timid mm, and the Lady Abbess would peihaps sigh nhen they could oblam no tiding» of her But these persons could afloid her no help, and she «as necessanly compelled to
280 believe that her fate was hopeless yet her spirit rose in proportion as her mind pointed out innumerable dangeis and difficulties which might assail her, and drying her tears, she mentally said, Tear» are vain, they will but unfit me for the trials I may be doomed to encounter Let me not foisake myself, foi upon my own exertions, and the pro vidcuce of Heaven I am entirely thrown Mankind forsakes me, but there is a Being, who is able to extricate me, even from thc jaws of death I will not there foie despair The Holy Virgin will protect me ' Wearied at length by the fatigues of the join ney, and the harass ment of her spints, she yielded to the influence oí sleep and forgot all her sorrows for a tune

\ hapless wanderer doom'tl to rove o'« lull And dale, witliout я friend ta cheer her Ou her way—or whisper peace to ber fearful Woman a mind. She was not always thus. Tint Time, In his rapid course, treads down alike Our hopes, our joys, our fenrs----- Tew were her years, hut ehe measured daya A* j ears, for th'unhappy live all their time, And ev'ry hour leems—two Old Tlav Gertrude slept for some time, and when slie awoke thc shades of night were at odds with morning ; the sky was clear, and thickly studded with stars, — though their splendour was somewhat eclipsed by the radiance of the queen of night, whose broad disk, sinking as it were towards the horizon, slowly and magnificently, displayed an
282 extensive and apparently interminable plain No noise was heard save that produced by the footsteps of their own horses 1 he matchless canopy of heaven and the extensive plain was all that met the gaze of the enthusiastic Gertrude Her feelings were such as she could not have descnbed They were de lightful, vast and inteiminable space are allied to the sublime, and wrapt in a soothing melancholy, Gertrude s mind assumed a seraphic tone She had known no kindred mmd to whom the sublimity of the present scene carried her thoughts, they therefore ascended to heaven In this pleasing and serene state of mmd, she remained till the rising dawn, and the soft rushing ot the wind along the heath mteriupted her contemplation But now the sky was at times overcast, and the sweep ing blast howled piteously along the waste Nicolai hurried on tht tired
283
beasts, for tho thunder muttered in the distance, and thc foiked lightning ran shivering along the ground Some thing at length attracted his notice , at first he thought it was a tree, but it proved a more welcome shelter, for it was a small hut, probably erected by a shepherd, now de sérted, and they noie glad to shelter themselves from the pitiless storm, beneath its humble roof The beasts appeared terrified at the lightning, and Nicolai blinded their eyes Here they remained foi some time, and to Gei trude s delight, as thc heavy clouds rolled slowly away she dis cerned the first bnght stieaks of ap proaching day Nicolai seemed no less pleased than herself, and looking anxiously round the waste for a beacon to direct his steps, (for here were no paths), he dis covered at a consideiable distance a speck which rose above the level line
284.
oi thc horizon Towards that he di rected his steps, and as they nearcd it, Gertrude discovered it was a building She strained her eyes to ascertain its form and nature she imagined it was a watch tower, such in fact it had been, but it was now untenanted and ruinous As she approached nearer to it, she heard the noise of waters dashing as it were against a rock She listened at tentively, for it was the only sound which met her ear The building had been square, but more than one ot its angles was worn away, and tinged as it was with the golden tints of the rising sun, it assumed a venerable and pic turesque appearance The ivy, the first mark of vegetable life they had seen for some time, except the heaths and furze bushes which enamelled the plain, had crept from its base to its summit, and hung in rich luxuiiance from the top of the building, falling from thence in graceful festoons, it almost closed the
28S
ruined entrance The foot of the rock upon which it stood was washed by thc sea which still ivas agitated, and like the restless spirits who were so busily engaged in its vicinity, struck terror into the heait of Gertrude, as she ap jnehended she was about to embark on its stormy bosom At some little dis tance she obseıved a vessel moored in the ofhng A heavy sigh accompanied the reflection, and overpowered those feelings which at a moment less inte resting would have dilated her heart and filled it with images of the most pleasing kind But in vain thp sun illumined the restless waves, in vain it tmged their white foam.wtth a bulhancy which dazzled the eyes ofthe beholders The gloominess of her own thoughts the uncertainty of her futuie destiny, threw a spell upon all around her To be alone, as she thought with Nicolai in so desolate a spot, a fellow who appeared bound to his employers by
286 the mo»t unshaken fidelity, precluded all hope When she looked back upon the preceding part of her journey, the interminable waste presented itself, when she looked forward, the boundless ocean lay before her In this solitude nought seemed to connect her with her Iellow species except the dreaded vessel, which heaving to and fio had with dif ficulty weathered the late storm She had taken off her cloak and stretched it on thc rock to dry, and silently and still she remained with folded arms, while Nicolai busied himself in unsad dling thc horses This movement drew from her thc question as to " whether they were going to stop there " A short time, lady, was the reply , " and, as you perhaps are weary, you would do well to enter the building, the upper chamber is toleiably comfortable, and you may like to lay down when you have refieshed yourself I will clear the ivy away for you, the stairs is none
387
of thc best, as I suppose, it is some¬ time since I was here however, I will go first and see that all is safe ' Gtr trade thus left alone, her first impulse led her to look round to see if she could escape With breathless anxiety she turned her weeping ej es on every side, but the prospect was so dieary and so hopeless, that in despair she threw herself on the ground and la mented her haid fate, not in teais, but convulsive sobs Nicolais voice roused her fiom her lecuinbent posture She started up, and diawing her veil closely iound her, followed hnn into the first chambei, which was cold and comfoillcis, then pointing to the narrow winding stair, he bade hei ascend caicfully, as theie were many steps which wcie laulty He had kindled a firt, and spread lefreshment^ on the flooi, table there was none and, although the water still dnpped through some parts of the
288 roof, yet it was a species of happiness, and all happiness is comparative, to have an apartment wholly to herself, and to stretch her weary limbs at length Nicolai brought her a large dry cloak, and after she had eaten, l laced be foie her somethmg to drink, and then retired Soon after which she felt an involuntary drowsiness creep over her which she could not resist, and though she used bei utmost efforts to keeji awake, the effort was vain, and she unconsciously sunk into a heavy sleep This involuntary slumber arose from «ι powder which Tather Rupert had ¿iven to Nicolai, with order» to use it upon any emergency Until this mo ment it had not been required, and Nicolai would probably have been afraid to make use of it, had he not found hib master at his elbow to insist upon its» being administered Father Rupert not bemg under thc same necessity as Nicolai to travel by the bye paths, had
28D
arnved upon this spot some time pre¬ vious to the latter He had learnt at the last town he had stopped at that a vessel was on the point of sailing for Holland, and he had engaged a good large fishing vessel to take them on board at the ruined watch tower, and convey them to the ship in question, and, in order to lull suspicion of his real intentions, he told the fellow he was taking a nun to Flandeis, who had undergone the sentente of death, in short, the same tale as that which N1- tolat had imposed upon the countrym.in, adding only that she was his sistei and that it ivas by using the utmost exertion alone, that he had been able to gtt the sentence mitigated When Gertrude recovered her sensa tion, her intellects were by no means clear, and such a torpor pervaded her frame, that she had no power to move 01 even unclose her eyes She was sensible of being carried along by two persons, and now and then she seemed
290
to recognise Father Rupert's voice, and when thcy reached the foot of the stairs, they bore her through the lower apartment into the open air, a shrill whistle was answered by a voice below the rock , and Gertrude could perceive that her companions w ~« descending some place which requ ied both skill and caution slot v tl ey proceeded and in silence, exctpi -hat now and then a word of advice a» to 'heir situa tion was exchanged between them At lengih they reached the sandy beach, and Gertrude was lifted into the vessel and placed on a couch in an inner apart inent, and theie left So various were her fears, so multifarious were her sen sations, that she could scarcely arrange her thought» into any sort of order Like the waves of the troubled ocean on which she rode, the one etraced the impression of the othei w ithout leaving л trace behind In tin» state of listless ness she remained for some time, for no one came near her, and when at last
891
she heard the approach of footsteps, fear was the prevailing emotion they excited " Daughter, ' said Father Rupert, entermgand closing thedoor,' "Daugh ter, I have brought you refreshments , that is one object of this visit, the next one is to inform you, that from this vessel we shall embark on board a larger one, which w.ll convey us to Flander you will do wisely to allow this event to take place in the usual manner Wrap yourself closely in your cloak, and allow vourself to be put on board like other people If not I shall resort to the stratagem which conveyed you hither Speak, Gertrude, give me your promise that you will make no resist¬ ance, and assume at least a virtue if you have it not One ofthe greatest and most amiable features in a woman's cha racter is submission You answer not' " I shall spare myself the repetition of the indignity I have already suffered,'' said Gertrude , " that of being carried О 2
292
¡nto the vessel. I shall need no sup¬ port, and have only to entreat, that you will give me timely notice, when it is necessary I should prepare for my re¬ moval. One vessel is as good a place of rest to me as another. I have no more to say, except to entreat you will believe, that I can submit cheerfully to ought but dishonourable treatment, and that I will resist." " Gertrude," said Father Rupert, with one ofhis most expressive smiles, " Lady Gertrude—heroic Gertrude—matchless heroine—hadst thou been permitted quietly to vegetate through life, we should have lacked an example of cou¬ rage, which is truly sublime and edify¬ ing. What a pity it is that thou hast no one to commend this high-flown speech ; truly it might grace the tales of a trou¬ badour. I could smile—but trifling is out of tune. Now, as ladies of' 10- mance are chaste, and fair, and true, and magnanimous, I shall interpret thy speech into a compliance with mv de-
293
mands —I dare not say obedience to my commands, and yet Gertrude may find hereafter the latter as applicable as the former Daughter, he added, fixing his eyes sternly upon her " beware how thou dost indulge such folly,—thy superiors own my sway and think not, with all thy heroism I shall be scorned by a silly way wai d girl I havt sworn, and I will keep my oath—that thou shalt be Lord Henry's bride As the monk said this, he rose and left the cibui, leaving Gertrude in a state of pitiable solicitude, while he ìepaired to Nicolai, and explained to lnm his future proceedings After about four houis sail, they came within sight of the Flemish vessel, and Gertrude received intimation from Nicolai of the circumstance Enveloping herself in her cloak, she followed hnn on deck, and was put on board with the other passengers, whose whispei» she heard, —" that s tht nun—th its the nun who is going abroad ' Hei face could not
294 be seen, therefore her indignant blushes were hidden, but her proud heart swell¬ ed at the bitter thought, that she was thus disgiaced, although hei name, lace, and place of abode weie unknown Their voyage was prosperous, and as far as actual peace was concerned, to Ger¬ trude peaceable, so little indeed had she been annoyed either by the presence ot Father Rupert or Nicolai, that she found a change might prove for the worse When, theiefore the latter informed hei that they were going on shore, she felt something like regret There was how¬ ever no alternative, and she entered the boat (for the water was low), whicli was to convey them on shore, and fol lowed Father Rupert, who led the way to a respectable looking house, at no very great distance from the shore The door wis opened to them by a middle aged-looking woman, wno cross¬ ed herself, seemed to shrink back, as if feaiful of coming in contact with a nun who had broken her vow. Ger
295
ti ude was shocked at observing this, and felt a considerable degree of rtsent ment against Father Rupert for this, be¬ yond all that his conduct to heiself pti sonally had failed to cxtite In this house they remained a short time, and then again commenced their journey During her residence at tin» place, she sa« no one but the womaii who, while she was in Gertrude s presence crossed herself repeatedly, and always appeared desirous to quit the room Her answeis to Gertrude's questions were laconic, sel dom extending beyond yes or no , and the poor girl's efforts to soften her into something like commontompassion weie vain Slander had preceded hei, and at every place, when they halted foi the night, she seemed to be shunned as an txcommumcated person This, perhaps, «as one of the greatest trials she had yet encountered Personal inconveni ι nee was not to be compared to it, it was a blow where woman is most sus eeptible, since the principal claim she
296
has upon the protection of the other sex and society at large, is a name pure and unsullied as the mountain snow And must weak woman then disown The change to which a world is prone ? In one meridian brightness shine, And nc er hke evening suns decline Ì Resolved and firm ? ------Is this What we demand of woman'—Yes Oh ' how cruel then, is the base and cowardly slanderer, who spares not tht fairest fame, who unfeelingly deprives the helpless of their strongest armour, and proud in his own guilty strength, ruins those he was born to protect, and overwhelms with sorrow those whom nature intended he should exalt and cherish Deeply did the barbed airow wound the sensitive heart of Gertrude, pale melancholy chased the roses from her cheek, and left the lily sovertign there As to the inconveniences which attend ed her journey, the fatigues she endured they scarcely were felt Nor was it till
297
they «ïpnroached the South of France, lhat she recovered observation enough to leel either pleasure or disgust from visi ble objects Upon arriving «it Lyons, however, she was roused to some of those feelings, which had formerly thrill ed her soul with delight the majesty ot the Rhone enchanted her, and the distant Alps towering aloft, and covered with everlasting snows, formed a spec tacle, which a mind like hers was fully capable of enjoying This part of France was at that time in better culti¬ vation than the eastern and northern ccunties The residence of Clement V , at Avignon (who died A D, 131Ф) had exilted a degiee of rivaliy among the inhabitants of Provence and Dauphini, which had greatly added to this beauty and luxuriance And although Gei trude could only make observation upon the shores which bounded the rivei yet she found an exquisite jileasuie in contemplating the garden scenery which adorned the western banks On tho
298
eastern side of the river the lands were cultivated with great care likewise, and the prospect was indeed far more pic turesque, for the projecting hills, which branched from the distant Alps, viere glowing with the fruits of the vine, the citron, and the orange trees, while their summits, clothed in more magnificent drapery, formed of the light foliage of the laidi, mountain ash, and firs, and pines of every description, appeared to wave to and fro, as the mountain breeze swept along the woods which adorned their wild and grotesque fronts The genius of cultivation seemed here to wanton with delight, for the enamelled meads disclosed her minor treasures in no less a degree of perfection, than she display¬ ed in the more lofty departments of the vegetable world Gertrude was never weary of contem plating these combined and opposite beauties Whether the hills were wrap¬ ped in shade, or glowing with the tints of a Claude—whether the foliage which
299
concealed their rugged sides, were en veloped in the purple gleams of evening or waved, like the spirits of the depart ed, in robes of a silvery hue, they were alme attractive to the highly enthusi asttc inind of the lovely Gertrude, whose blossoms of hope were thus untimely nipped in the bud, and all her prospects blighted by the cruel hand of oppres sion Ofttimes would she gaze upon the happy cottagers she saw enjoying them selves with their families on the banks of the river, till she could see them no more, then the sigh of anguish the feeling that she had no one to sympa thize if she wept, or to smile if she were pleased would overwhelm her heart, and m an undertone she would exclaim Happy happy cottagers Oh, thrice happy they who have a kindred soul to share their toys, their sorrows Tears would relieve her, and unm tiuded upon by Father Rupert, except once a day, she passed her time in al
300
ternate feelings of pleasure and pain, till they reached Toulon, where they disembarked, and for two or three clays took up their abode in a convent ; heie she was shewn into a little cell, and was attended upon by Father Rupert' him¬ self, who brought her food twice a day. «Solitude appeared to be her lot, and she began to think, that if she persisted in refusing Lord Henry as her husband, some cloister would be her retieat There, at least, she would have no 'rou¬ ble, but perhaps a severe monastic disci¬ pline ; but as she conceived Lord Henry to be the cause of all her sorrows, her dislike to him amounted now to perfect aversion. And certainly there can be no greater trial to a delicate mind, than a unton without affection, or at least esteem.
